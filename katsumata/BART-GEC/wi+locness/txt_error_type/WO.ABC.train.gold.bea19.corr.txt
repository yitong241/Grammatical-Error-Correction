In England , where I live , in Bedford , we use the train a lot to go to the most important towns in the UK , but the trains are very expensive . Me and my family are careful to go off peak because the prices are too high .
Sometimes the staff go on strike and we customers do not know in time . As a result , we can not get to work on time . That is one of the disadvantages of using public transport .
When we ask ourselves how we can take care of the environment ,
Perhaps when we are shopping in the supermarket or other shops we are doing something bad , because we ask the assistant for a bag or something similar to carry this food or other things home .
So , my favourite sport at the present time is street workout . I have been doing this sport for a long time already .
I do n't know why , but I go on the street almost every day in order to exercise .
But not now .
Because of this , he always defended his mother and always said the wife was the one responsible .
I believed him , but I did n't know how wrong I was .
He booked me the flight but he did n't pay for it , because at that moment he had n't got enough cash on him .
This summer several things happened to me . I went to the beach , I went to the pool , or simply went for a walk with friends , but the best thing was when I went to a wedding , because it was the event that brought me the most memories this summer .
I can tell you that I feel I can understand over 90% when I 'm listening and when I 'm reading , but my main problem with English is , of course , when I have to speak . I fee terrible and without confidence . I think that I 'm always thinking in Spanish and then doing the translation into English . Maybe at this moment , while I 'm writing this composition , I 'm making the same mistake . I know that learning English is a long process , but I must follow that process because I 'd like to be an excellent bilingual person .
Most of the Metro cities are nowadays attract city - dwellers towards the Metro , not only because of the fare , but because of the time that it saves .
The Metro is even good for the health of the people as there is no pollution because it runs on electricity and it also connects most of the city . As Delhi has a wide area span of Metro that is really awesome .
I do sports such as football , basketball and chess , and with these skills , I could help children have fun while teaching them all the benefits of doing sport .
The best thing that can encourage me to open this center is that I have 5 friends in my country who study in the faculty of languages and translation and I think that they will be very happy about joining me in my center .
Not only is sport when you feel sweaty , but you also do a lot of exercise .
Start and then you can explain to me how you are .

Well , ecologists say that getting around using public transport is more beneficial for the environment than using a car or motorbike .
But does it actually have a future ?
I suppose the government have also studied this situation .
Swimming has always been my favourite sport .
Today , I wake up at 07.00am and grab some kind of bread with jam , drink a coffee , but more often than not , just have time for half a mug and run to work .
She went to the train station and got a ticket to London .
She stood there and read the note again . The address was near to Big Ben .
It changes the person in a different way too .
If in a city people use public transport more than their own private vehicle , then it will help to protect the environment and ease traffic as well .
To sum up , doing sports is very important for teenagers , whose bodies are growing , and doing it regularly is a commitment that we should make . In my opinion , however , doing a mandatory sport is not educational because we must do a sport with enthusiasm , not bothered or out of obligation .
To sum up , TV viewing is not just entertaining at all ; It is definitely also educating .
This perspective on life is inspired by counter - culture movements and some people call these people " alternative " , but they are more common each day and this creates an inclusive and diverse society .
They searched for flight tickets , rental car , and hotel .
Michael tried to think wisely again .
He called his friends back and managed to sort out the mess .
But is that a big problem in our lives or a small problem , or does it really not matter ?
Or do you really regret what you have done ?
after that last point We can not go everywhere we would like using a car .
I am only waiting to go there another time !
Unfortunately , Max was not as excited as his family ; he had never really been into animals .
For example , new computers are smaller in size than the old computers , they are also faster and more efficient , they have better resolution and a bigger memory to save files and other stuff like apps .
In the last year , some politicians have decided to put our city in order . So , for example , they put again to place the roads .
We still have many problems to solve in our city .

He had already asked all the family about this , nobody had n't idea what would be good enough .
Sorry for taking so long to get back to you , it 's the end of the quarter and you know how crazy this period is for a salesman .
But if somebody wants to follow the latest fashion , I accept it , because she just feels good in those clothes .
However , I strongly believe that the measurement of education level does not explicitly interest with sex differences in classes , but it is also related to the quality of education in schools .
My sister is two years older than me .
My father is another important person to me .
When I was a child , about four or five years old , my father taught me what football was , and I loved it , but , I really liked the goalkeepers . Why have I liked football since my childhood ?
As a result , we could have more comfortable public transport .
In my opinion , public transport could have a future if we all collaborate to improve it .
One day he had a fight with his sister . He even made her cry . Both of them stopped talking to each other and , after some days , the boy needed his sister Sukh 's laptop .
Sukh was so angry with him because he hurt her a lot . Sukh refused to give him her laptop and her brother started fighting with her again and he even slapped his sister .
The room 's number was 666 .
I did n't have free time .
My family ordered dinner , but l specially ordered pizza and Coke because l love pizza .
If there were only cars in a city , the city would n't have enough parking spaces and roads , all the cars would jam the city , and people would n't get to their destinations .
Therefore , these are the reasons why I agree with the form to reduce congestion and air pollution by encouraging people to use private cars less and turn to using more public transportation and other forms for transportation .
But public transport has a future for a lot of reasons . First , time . If the place you want to reach is really far , the different types of vehicles of public transport will get you there faster than your car . Also , the complications about the field , like if you want to go from America to Europe , there is no highway that crosses the ocean . You need an airplane and , unless you have one , you will not be able to achieve travel between continents with your car . A different reason is politics , because if you want to go from anywhere in the USA to Alaska , you will not need to pass through Canada . Comfort is a really important reason , because driving for 8 hours is exhausting and it will also be unsafe . Economics is a factor too , because the wear and tear on your car will be more than in normal use and the price of food and extra stops that you will need to do . It will be more expensive than on public transport .
Information via the Internet had beem more quickly each day and it is reaching all parts of the world .
However , the advancement of technology , besides bringing advantages for everyone , will also cause disadvantages , such as unemployment , because machines will do the same work or work better than humans .
And I also love children .
Which capacity and model will we work on ?
We stayed in three different hotels and , one day , we also went to the sea in Giardini Naxos .
universe is expanding and we still know little about it .
He studied a degree in law at university .
I have been playing this sport since twelve years ago . This sport has taught me to respect others and not to assault them.there is the only reason that makes me choose this sport is that I do n't want to be weak . I would n't like to be nothing in this country that has a rule : the strong dominate the weak . When I step foot in the gym , I forget everything : school , home ... . Therefore , I enjoy it .
And unfortunately , this bad impact exists in almost all areas of life .
Although traveling by car is really interesting , using public transport still has its advantages . By using public transport you 're saving effort . When driving a car for a long distance , you will get tired . Some people do n't have enough money to buy their own car .
Once you raise it , it will regard you as its owner .
I hope you can take down the photos of the cat being abused and you can really reflect . Do n't repeat the same mistakes .
Because I really love to work with people of all ages , and I would like to have this post and I 'm an energetic and hardworking person .
It will not be trendy because everybody will have his own car .
Television can be a useful instrument if it is used with caution . Therefore , I recommend using it less to prevent damage to the mind .
Besides , it will always be useful for people who ca n't drive .
To sum up , I would say that people will use public transport more and more , as petrol is getting expensive .
It can always make us save money and make the environment more natural and fresh .
From the first time , I said to you that I had a problem with my health , but you answered : it does not matter .
We are here to introduce you to the shopping facilities and shops in this town .

Abortion has to be taken seriously in order to avoid these immoral actions , as these fetuses are being deprived of their rights , since they already have a life .
I have learned to get control of myself when someone teases me , and to be alert as well . Also , it helps me to always look slim and put me away from the ghost of obesity as well . People who want to start doing karate have to be patient .
Compared to the plane , the train is relatively safe because it can only move on the land .

I like Ricki Rikonen so much . He is a Ferrari team driver .
Two years after his essay was released , he would understand that his essay was wrong . Moreover , Michael would want to apologise to many people who read his essay , so , Michael now goes home , takes a cup of tea , and goes to bed . Thus , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
One day , a man and his wife were trying to find a place that was shallow and without pollution to cultivate . They were poor ; they did n't have the necessary resources , but the husband worked so hard because his wife had had an accident . It happened one day that his wife was working on a campaign for the conservation of endangered animals . She went to a place in search of animals . She heard a sound in a dark place in the jungle , so she went to investigate what that was . A creature that had never been seen attacked her . Her partner only heard a shout and they found Lucy , the wife of the man , on the floor . They asked her if she was OK , but she did n't answer , so her partner took her to the doctor . There , the doctor said that she was OK but she would never hear again unless she paid 1 , 000 dollars for an operation .
My school is fine and I like my country better than yours ; our teams are better than yours . England are the worst at football , Argentina rules .
But friends may go away in the future or hurt you ! So you ca n't always rely on them ! For example , they need you until they find someone better than you and , in the end , they go away .
These people , those who live in a city , do not take their own car or do not have one .
No one can deny how very important sport is to our health .
I started this sport when I was 10 years old . where My father was also playing this sport , but he started it when he was older than me . He was about 30 years old . where Squash is one of those games that can be played at any age . I love this game because I find it exercises the whole body at the same time . We run in a small space , moving our hands in stretched and different ways , and at the same time we work our minds , so it needs care and quick thinking , as much any as exercise you will find down the road .
I think that anyone who wants to start a doing sport should play squash , which gives a you flexible and healthy body . At the same time , this sport can be played for a long period of time without caring about age .
Squash can also be played individually , as two players together , or in a team of 4 players . squash is one of the very nice attractive sports .
After printing well , these sheets are closely manually inspected .
Or sometimes during the day you see horror movies which should not be on .
This attitude is based more on the backgrounds of the people rather than on the system itself .
Even then , you only have to find three more players in this case .
I looked every day for some summer work and I found an excellent option .
They were always so friendly , and so kind ... that it was strange to imagine that ending . But that was the sad reality .
They had to decide who their cat would stay with .
Michael was a very intelligent boy .
Getting there , she knocked on the door .... Michael opened the door and Mia asked if he had a cup of water to give him and he said no way would he give a cup of water to an old person .
They even asked me who I wanted to go with . They grabbed my hands , wanted me to go with them , but I had no idea , because I love my mother and my father so much .
First , I registered at a swimming pool , then I went back to the swimming pool every day early in the morning .

Then , the preparation of metal plates is the next stage . note should be skilled machinists .

And then , the sheets are printed . Operators have to pay attention to the colour on both sides , special ink , and slightly raised images .
It has a big mall that has recently been opened , and it contains everything the visitors might need .
On the other hand , the mall lacks a cinema or some restaurants as it has recently been opened .
Who are we ?
To summarize , because the development of public transport is more and more complete , the advantages of travelling by car have been replaced gradually by public transport . The future of public transport is bright .
It is a bit far from my home , behind the petrol station where we once left your car .
As a result of what I have just said , in my opinion , people wo n't have a " real life " . Everyone will always be more involved in virtual life , so that they will forget how to talk to each other and how to express their own feelings !
Do not ruin our life . It could all be so perfect !
On public transport , people are obliged to share transport with strangers and we also have to follow company policy or regulations , but with our own transport , we do n't have to bother about these things . We travel when we want and when we have time .
I 'm writing you a letter because I have made a short film with my friends , and I want to tell you what the film is about and what the experience was like .
On the other hand , the bad thing about when there is such delicious food , is that you always want to eat some typical food from your country and in the end it 's very bad for the body because we eat it to excess .
When we use a car , in general , one person is the only person who is accustomed to using their own car , so this is not exploiting the potential of the car .
I was impressed because I ' d never seen such films before .
This report aims to give a clear idea about preserving the environment in my town .
Shopping will also be on the internet ; everything will be !
I would n't mind eating there every day !
The reason for choosing the English language specifically next September I would like to get to know more information about an English language course .
When I was ten years old , I really liked to play football very much . I joined a football team which is near to my home . I prefer this team because my family is not rich , they can not provide for my transportation fees to go to do exercise at a stadium .
Fifty minutes passed , and my body was no longer sore .
We love to travel here and there , but this is the place I have wanted to go a since long time ago .
Following your letter , I want to tell you about the apartment . It is very beautiful , not big or small , but medium - sized with two rooms inside , a bathroom and a dining room and an external director categorize overlooking a beautiful view . I am sure he will like it . to come and Tri condo b soon , n the end , I would say that I miss you so much and I hope to see you soon .
I do n't know where the stress of words is .
So , based on what I have written , I think shopping is not always very happy . We can easily find something much happier than shopping .
HOW CAN YOU BEST LOOK AFTER YOUR ENVIRONMENT ?
But there are some problems , like these - how will a lot of people drive who do n't like to drive or ca n't drive because they have some problems with their health .
I ran to help them and we also called an ambulance .
, even though , when the public transport gets so crowded , it is indeed less harmful , in terms of the impact on the environment , because it means more individuals in the same place , whereas each new car means increasing pollution .
In the village where I live , there is a lot of vegetation . For that reason , we try to protect the environment . One of the things we do is to do maintenance every week to the vegetation zone , checking if there is any garbage . To avoid this , we teach the younger generation environmentalist actions so they do n't throw cans , paper , or candies on the floor . They can also help the older people . There are cases where a person throws garbage on the street or on the vegetation . To avoid that happening again , we have a punishment that is to pay some money . If they do n't , they wo n't be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again , unless they are visitors . In that case , we tell him or her the way we live in the village and , we give him or her advice to keep a beautiful place without garbage .
I am so interested in this major .
Nowadays , in school , we learn a lot of subjects which we use more or less in our lives . Some of them are really important , but some of them are just a waste of time .
I think that is not a problem of awareness .
We are looking for a salary range between $ 42 to $ 90 per hour , and only 2 days per week .
I ask myself If I had the possibility to change the world , would I try to do all that in your hands .
The best place I have ever been is on an island in the east archipelago in Sweden .
Most people say that using public transport is better than using cars , and they say that it 's cheaper and better for the environment . As for me , I think that cars are easier and an affordable way to travel between places , because cars are here anytime and so near to your home , unlike public transportation , which you have to walk to to reach in most countries . And also , cars are available all the time . You can go at 4 am and no one will say anything , because it 's yours , but most public transportation is available only for the daylight hours and a few hours at night , in an emergency situation for example , what will you do if you do not have your own car ? Your kid is sick , or your wife or your elderly parents . And , in general , the more we rely on ourselves , the more our government is able to help the poor and homeless people out there , who really need more help and aid from the public community . We merely ask the government to improve the streets and the traffic light systems , and more petrol stations and parking in the streets , to be able to drive and move around easily and safely and in a short amount of time .
If you walk at the seaside in the evening you can also have the possibility to see the sunset over the sea .... that 's great emotion ! I feel good in that way and even my soul can have a breath .
I suggest everybody should have the same evening walk . You just need a pair of comfortable shoes !
Looking on a wider span , cars are available these days according to public demand .
This sport causes fresh and jolly me and I think exercise will cause me to be healthy . If you start volleyball , you need a ball and a piece of ground that is separated by a net .
Technology advances way too fast and it is really difficult to guess what kind of stuff or artefacts there will be fifty years from now , but we can guess some ideas , like flying cars , smartphones the size of a small piece of paper , really thin laptops like a quarter of an inch , clothes that clean themselves or change color and shape , healthier food , smarter domestic appliances .
Once upon a time there was a little girl living in a small town .
I am writing about the international sports monthly magazine I have seen .
I also like walking in public streets , gardens , clubs and on the shore . When I want to go anywhere , I do my best to go on foot .
I advise any people who suffer from laziness and obesity to try to walk for at least one hour and after that they will like this sport .
People start to play football on a regular pitch . After some time , they will be tired , but it is normal because their muscles are not strong enough for running around the pitch many times .
If you train often , your muscles will become very strong .
Not only will this solve pollution , it will also help us to get rid of obesity .
After we said hi and I went inside with him , he told me that our mom was going on a trip for a week and we had to take care of our little sister .
After some ages we can not attend any of this type of activity because we are all old . So let go and enjoy your youth and be happier .

Tell me what kind of suit the witness has to wear , whether I have to bay any colour of tie , a flower .... I 'm really very excited about your wedding .
Anyway , congratulations to you and Jenny again .

The Internet can also be used to study and to educate yourself ; the internet allows us to read books , magazines and short stories .

He has never been the most famous guitarist in the world . He was just one more guitar player .

Before starting to talk about the members of my family and if they are my best friends or not , I just want to say that my family is the thing I love most in my life . I respect them , appreciate them also , and I think they are the best thing in my life .
The family member I love most and think is my best friend , is my sister . She is older than me by about 12 years . I can tell her anything about my life , myself , my feelings , I also think if I fell in love , she would be the first to know .
About the rest of my family , as I said before , they are just a relatives , but even if they are not friends , I do love them so much . The first one is my aunt , the dead one , and the other one is still alive . But I do n't feel that feeling of love towards my uncle . I do love him , but he is just my uncle , no more .
Look for a sport to make you feel good and your brain will always be refreshed , so that you can begin your day with any sport to make fresh and after that you can do any job with a refreshed mind .
Then they drank a coffee that give them a lot of energy to construct the building faster . This coffee has an ingredient so that people can live all night .

Everything was organized .
By train , you do n't always have room for your luggage .
By plane , you can hand your luggage in at the check - in or you can take the hand luggage with you . You can always be sure that you will find a place for your luggage .

At school I always play with friends and never play alone and my friends and I always win .
It is very difficult to deny the importance of family in our lives . Families definitely play an essential role in society . According to the experts , we ca n't create a successful society without creative families , and another specific part of our lives is good partners surrounding our daily activities .
So the does n't go outside in the day , and in a room there can not be more than one candle at a time ; it has to always be dark in the house .
Another example of why lives are going to change completely in 50 years is because , also , that connection with other cultures makes people more concerned about their own health , their expectations of life and the way they want to live it , because every day it will be easier to see how much we are hurting the earth , so we will see faster the impacts that this has on our lives .
In the end , large colleges admit larger numbers of students , so the students may establish more friendships with people of different nationalities . Also they serve the community by qualifying many students in various majors .

It is a gripping film , starring Scarlett Johanson and Morgan Freeman in quite good acting , that will keep you tense until the last scene and does n't leave you feeling unpasible .
I like this trailer and I think that the film would be cool .
Also , I believe that lifeguard could be a good job , because , in summer , the people go to the beach and they need lifeguards .
On the other hand , people should think about the environment , pollution , global warming , which are all currently warning .
We should think of a better future and try to be environmentally friendly - try to avoid the huge amount of pollution which is caused by cars and not think only of our comfort .
In fact , in some overdeveloped countries maybe it will disappear , because I suppose travelling by car is much cheaper and faster .
Michael had just realized that he had n't heard the alarm clock , so he got in a panic immediately : - I ca n't arrive late for work .
Furthermore , they give advice to all those novices at basketball " do n't ever lose the passion " , because if they give up , they wo n't play with the biggest players in the world .
I think one of my favorite sports of all is athletics . I love it because it is a sport where you prove yourself , you have to be better every day than you were yesterday . It forces you to improve every time . Also , it is an exercise that helps your whole body , especially the legs , because it gives them great strength , but also your hands , because they have to be in constant movement , and all the body in general , because you run and your metabolism is accommodated and helps you to have coordination .
I recommend all people who want to run , if you do n't feel like you 're improving , keep going anyway and with time you will see results .
I would advise you to the person starting the sport endeavor and can fulfill their dream . Many ca n't get what they accomplished . Those players are very famous today .
Otherwise everybody wants a better future .
Another good option is to give them a difficult job to keep them busy every day . But I do n't know what kind of job it could be , because a person who commits a crime is n't going to do something to help society , like community service .

She arrived with a piece of crumpled paper , on which she had only written a name in a different style of letter , only there reflected , exposing the moment everyone laughed at her for her work , but the teacher said :
There is debate about whether everyone should have to do military service when they reach 18 years old .
Consequently , people could be more independent and strong . They seem to become mature earlier than other people who do not do military service .
For instance , some countries allow people to do military service after all their courses have finished .

All governments are increasing their policies and laws relating to this topic and they also promote new rules in the daily life of the population .
One of the new rules for the reduction of pollution in the cities is public transport .
These cities do n't allow people to drive in the city centre , and the industry reduces its taxes if it 's increasing the politic nature .

Playing badminton can do lots of great things for you . Apart from being good for your health , it can also be a lot
But , why will it disappear ?
Using public transport we will avoid traffic and so many accidents , so why do n't we use it more ?
I think that travelling by car is good because you have your own seat and in the winter your car is hot and you can also listen to the radio .
Finally , public transport involves more costs , because public transport ( such a buses , trains ) fares are increasing every year , and we do not face this problem with private transport .
Now I will talk about the Daruma , a Japanese restaurant that was a very good experience for me .
I do n't really have an opinion , I just do n't know . We will have to wait and find out .

I can give advice to people who are interested in playing cricket . They must know all the rules of cricket before playing it .
Usually I was a volunteer , but I was also part of a few European Projects where I was paid for my work .
-Why are we here ? - Margarita asks .
As we know , public transportation is not a direct way to get to all our destinations and it forces us to stop at many stops first . Moreover we have to take another one to reach our destination , so it is already obvious why using a car is better .
Firstly , it leads to global warming , since the concentration of pollution is higher in many countries , and actually it is not only leading to but also making global warming faster and can also threaten our health .

Firstly , it allows you to go somewhere directly , without finding out information about the timetables of public transport such as buses or trains .
If you travelled by bus or train , you would probably spend more time walking along the streets to your final destination .
Although it has some benefits , in most parts of the country , especially in the smallest towns , the public transport is not developed enough .

First , I want to explain to you what happened to me on Saturday morning . I had to meet up with my friend Matus at 14 am , so when he told me that he could n't come over and could we meet up later , you can imagine how angry he made me , because I ca n't put up this kind of person who is always late .

To whom it may concern ,
In this essay we are talking above all about rich people .
I am only sure about one thing : technologies will have a more important place in our lives .

I would like to think that in the future we will explore the universe more and we will colonise other planets .
Even if people do n't use public transport nowadays , in the future they will .

Nowadays , in order to have the best for the current and future generations , there are common international ways for individuals to contribute to solving environmental problems .
Whereas if you are going there to party with friends or watch a game , you get a table in a suitable place . I believe that if we could all go to this restaurant at the end of our course , we will surely have a great time .
Second , shopping malls have places full of advertisements and loud songs playing .
Football is the most beautiful sport in the world . It 's the dream profession of almost all boys when they are kids . When you play in your neighbourhood , you are playing that you 're Messi , or Cristiano Ronaldo or your favourite player of your team .

Almost everybody has at some time thought of taking a gap year between leaving school and starting university , but do we really know all the advantages and disadvantages that it entails ?
This has a devastating effect on their independence and living freely .
This is the reason why self - driving cars may be something only for rich people in the near future .
During summer it is common to see many people in parks practising sports , like running , cycling , or just doing every kind of physical activity .

However , I think that this mode of transport has some disadvantages . For instance , if there are a lot of cars in a small city , pollution will increase and the environment will be damaged .

However , it will remain in the future , as many people still use it or even depend on it .

So it did not materialize for the transport sector often necessary capacity to provide reliable and safe transportation and moderate costs and , in spite of the high demand for transportation services in the Arab countries , public transport systems are still undeveloped and compel people to rely on private cars .
It has been observed , for example , that the increase in the number of cars varied between 7 and 10 percent per year in Jordan and this situation is similar to what happens in other Arab countries , and despite the investments in roads and infrastructure in the last few decades , the performance of this sector remains weak as a result of severe congestion in urban centers and poor air quality in many cities , land degradation and high rates of emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
On the other hand , the pessimistic view , in developed countries like Japan and Kuwait we do n't find problems like these because they have good planning , they make routes underground and overground , then they have routes only for people and routes only for cars . Finally , we should have a good plan and the government should care about that and plan for traffic regulation to solve this problem .
This happens because , not only do we live in big cities , but we also have no time to waste .
Considering that companies are now moving to the outskirts of cities and there is a lack of more flexible timetables , some people discount the public transport option .

I have two different reasons to explain why I want to study at BSC in Oxford again .

For adults , we have a little old museum where you can live one day like sixty years ago . So , if you have never been in one , you should go , because it does not cost very much . Besides , the museum has a kindergarten for the kids .

It has been affecting the environment , causing climate change , increasing droughts , and flooding areas thanks to the increasing demand for using petrol for private cars .
First of all , if they are staying in České Budějovice , they can spend at least three days there sightseeing .
There is a huge number of shops in the centre , so what about going shopping ? Sightseeing in this town is very convenient for tourists because they can reach everything on foot .

Near The Roquetas Concert Hall , you will find a Japanese restaurant named " Ichiban " . Opened a few years ago , it 's not well known yet , but this does n't prevent it quickly getting busy at lunch time at the weekends .

I have taken courses in First Aid and I am even doing a course as a personnel trainer for children with some delay and disability .
I have been learning English for 8 years and after I sat r the FCE exam two years ago , as soon as I passed the exam , I started preparing for the certificate in advanced English exam so that I could demonstrate my English skill even more , both written and spoken .
Finally , I am available to have an interview if you consider my qualifications positively .
In addition , having been equipped with my rather good English - speaking skills and cross - cultural communication skills obtained during my time working as a receptionist for a Canadian mining company , I feel very confident and approachable when dealing with customers .
Unfortunately , the reality impels me to admit that young people have more opportunities to enjoy life because of all the technological advances that older people tend not to understand well .
Also , because of the fact that urbanization has not helped most countries to adapt the cities into more accessible places for senior citizens .
The process of this fact becoming real and common in our society began about 100 years ago , and what is really interesting , nearly 95 percent of people in advanced society can not imagine the world without any kind of information about famous people and their existence at all .
Furthermore , street children are a result of family troubles .
Secondly , governments should teach their people how to protect the environment , such as making them aware that destroying too much farmland is a bad choice .
My opinion is that only a minimum of money is necessary .
This should be enough to make you feel happy like a comfortable blanket does .
Some say that having money to buy the latest gadget makes you feel happy .
Actually , if that 's the case , the happiness will only be for a short time .
First of all , as dioxides and carbon gases have been increasing ozone pollution in big cities worldwide , awareness campaigns should be promoted to highlight the alternative use of transportation .
So , if my mental estimates are correct , there should still be enough space available to also place a little armchair , where I could read more comfortably than in my bed or in my desk chair , not very far from the window .
I 'm a friend to him rather than a strict mother .
I do not agree with that at all .
Of course there is a future for it , and more and more every day .
However , it probably wo n't be invented after all .
Thanks to learning another language , you can also have friends from all over the world and you can better understand the culture of a new country .
And sometimes maybe you do not want to hear what people are speaking about in a foreign language .
In conclusion I would like to say that the learning of another language will always be important for today 's people and the next generation too , and in addition , the need to communicate in another language will increase .
With technology we will clean our house , technology will protect us , we will spend our free time with technology .

The old man answered $ 20,000 .

Those questions are : where do we come from and how ?
It was about what problems we are going to have in a few years if we do n't change anything related to polluting our environment .
In particular , I have been dealing with children with disabilities for 10 years .
A few years ago , I also had the chance to work for 1 year in a school for disabled children and young people in a rural area of Ghana .

I 'm a 17-year - old Italian student . I have a B1/2 level English . I 'm cheerful and hard working .
Italy is famous for its typical food and rich culture of arts and history .
We all know that the Roman Empire affected Italian culture and history a lot . In fact , if you want to go on a tour around the most beautiful cities in the country , you should definitely go to Florence , Venice , Naples and many others .

The young bridegroom is then involved in a brawl and banished from the village .
The year was 2012 , and I had n't written anything until that day - I had just been translating some stories and , once , even subtitles for a Korean movie from English and Spanish .
It sounded like quite a good challenge for me , so after finishing the lessons , I quickly sat down and started writing .

And the more I won competitions , the more proud I was of myself .
