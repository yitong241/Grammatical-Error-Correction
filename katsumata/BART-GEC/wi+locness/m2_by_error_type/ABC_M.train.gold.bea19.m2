S In this essay , I am going to discuss whether building a bypass around our town is beneficial to our community or not .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One of the advantages pointed out by local politicians in the meeting was that this bypass would lower the rate of air pollution around town , which I highly agree with because the extra traffic caused due to the passing cars added to the vehicles used by the locals cause massive smog in the atmosphere , not to mention being terribly bad to the health of the walking , cycling citizens , especially young children , babies .

S Mostly during 7 to 8 am and 3 to 4 pm , when people go and finish work , that is when we get the most awful traffic jams , sometimes it takes an hour to get form point A to B in town which is a terribly long time not to mention parents who have to take their children to school , nursery and then get to work , too .

S On the other hand , friendship is a two way street where you receive and give back the same favors and , naturally , I enjoy doing so .

S We are going to compare the lyrics from the following three songs : Miley Cyrus ' Wrecking Ball ; Anastasia 's Left Outside Alone ; and Taylor Swift 's Back to December .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We have chosen these three songs because they all deal with the same topic of breaking - up , but they describe this topic from different points of view , even though the three songs are performed by female singers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These songs are relatively modern , but if we take a look we will find some sexism in some parts .
A 12 12|||M:PUNCT|||,|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is the case of the " free choice " song , Taylor Swift .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Anastasia 's song tells a story of a victim , meanwhile the others talk about women that fell guilty because they have hurted men .
A 11 11|||M:PUNCT|||,|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Also , we think that these songs can represent different kinds of processes and language we have seen in class .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This type of process has been found in the three songs and it is very prolific .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Usually , in these types of songs , the performers describe actions in the relationships as well as at the end of it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The material processes are carried out by agents , which coincide with the subject .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The subject of the sentence can also be the force if the agent is inanimate .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In this category of processes , there is another participant known as the affected , because the action of the verb affects or concerns it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S According to Berkow ( 2004 ) , Airway management is one component of anaesthesia procedure to ensure the patient airway is opened .
A 19 19|||M:NOUN:POSS|||'s|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S An example of an intervention in airway management is the ventilation mask that Mr. Sharma was using .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Also , this practice is the primary consideration for an efficient post anaesthesia care ( Scoot , 2012 ) .
A 12 12|||M:PUNCT|||-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The majority of patients that has had a general anaesthetic , as Mr. Sharma , must recover in a PACU ( Post Anaesthesia Care Unit ) to monitor the vital signs , specially the airways management due to the anaesthesia , impeding any postoperative complication ( Scoot , 2012 ; Farrell & Dempsey , 2011 ) .
A 22 23|||M:PUNCT|||- anaesthesia|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Addressing the airway management after Mr. Sharma 's admission on PACU , the first procedure that the nurse should do , is follow the A - G assessment protocol , to review the stability and the airway patency of the patient , sustaining the pulmonary ventilation to prevent hypoxemia and hypercapnia ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
A 37 38|||UNK|||patency|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Mr. Sharma 's airway should be spare and clean from mucus or blood ( Pudner , 2010 ) .
A 6 7|||UNK|||spare|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Due to the surgery Mr Sharma is in supine position , but this position reduces his oxygenation ( Snowball , 2012 ) , and also can impede the air passage that is related to the anaesthesia effect , where the tongue and the lower jaw fall backward .
A 4 4|||M:PUNCT|||,|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0
A 8 8|||M:DET|||a|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Hence , he needs oxygen supply to prevent any airway obstruction .

S Thus , Mr. Sharma is been given O2 via Hudson mask 6L / min , because he received general anaesthesia and all of his muscles are relaxed and at the moment he do not have control over his reflexes ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .

S Do n't worry , I 'll try to make it easy for you to decide which is the option that suits you best .

S On the one hand , you 've been doing sport since you were seven years old and I understand it 's very important for you .

S However , as far as I 'm concerned , it 's not necessary to work out that much to be healthy .

S As a matter of fact , you just have to eat a balanced diet and do sport twice or three times a week .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That way , you will be able to do sport as well as going to music classes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , you love playing piano and , in my opinion , you wo n't be able to keep it up if you give up music classes , as you do n't have any instruments at home .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Besides , I do n't think your parents would buy you a piano , since it would really annoy your neighbours .

S Besides , as I have already said , you can exercise three or four hours a week instead of going every day to your training session .

S I am writing to inform you that the package holidays to Madrid you are currently advertising in your newspaper are apparently not what they claimed to be .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Generally , the holiday as a whole was good enough as the most important -in my opinion- aspects , like the quality of the guided tours and the accommodation , was very high .
A 10 10|||M:PUNCT|||,|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Nevertheless , there were many inaccuracies in the advertisement and certain aspects of the holiday were chaotic .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The tourist agency made group bookings , which resulted in the unusually low price of the holiday package .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Spending holidays with a group can be very convenient and for some people is the only way of travelling , but the advertisement did not state clearly that it concerned this particular type of holiday , which made me and some others feel deceived .

S We had several problems , especially with the bus , which was often delayed and in one case it even caused us to miss a scheduled guided tour .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I believe there is plenty of room for improvement since , although the problems were not insuperable , they caused great inconvenience .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , a better transport agency should be found for the former difficulties to be prevented .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Secondly , advertisements should be clearer as it is very easy for someone to misunderstand them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It can not escape our minds that at this stage and age , children are exposed to sexual images from a very early age and some people would argue that our society is hyper sexualised , which is a reason why many parents see single sex schools as a means to protect their offspring from having sexual thoughts before they are ready to understand the complexity of sex and sexual relationships .

S While the hyper sexualisation of our society may be a reality that many parents would want to protect their children from , it is true to say that children need to adapt and be ready for the society in which they live and for may parents , sending their children to a mixed sex school is just a natural environment , much more similar to the " outside world " in which they would grow to adulthood .

S Considering how much time children spend at school , it appears to me that choosing a single sex school will make the child , somehow , segregated and in many cases , reinforce some of the may stereotypes that we , as society , have regarding gender which , if we take into consideration that these children are going to be the future leaders , educators , lawyers , politicians and so on , I would argue that the more schools reflect our society and the way that we like it to be , the better , not only for the child as a person , but the child as a key in the future of the country and , as an extent , to the world .

S Firstly , as mentioned before , it would give everyone the opportunity to communicate with everyone .

S Moreover , the standardised educational system would also need people who teach and instruct others so the world language will be established everywhere .

S The educational system would also provide a valuable basis for the world of politics so conflicts might be prevented due to the lost language barrier with its vulnerability and risks of misunderstandings .
A 14 14|||M:PUNCT|||,|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the one hand there would be a great loss of cultures and in some cases the implementation of the educational system might be impossible , for instance the aboriginal people .

S First , to travel by boat is a very relaxing and carefree experience , compared to being confined to a very narrow and limited little space on the seat of a plane .

S For today 's teenagers it is hard to imagine life before mobile phones although it did exist only some decades ago .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Few technical inventions have had such a deep impact on our daily life as this little thing .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , there are various advantages and disadvantages to a mobile phone and everyone has to decide for him- or herself in which way to use this medium .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First of all , the mobile phone is a great way to " stay connected " all the time . Chatting with your friends , staying informed of the latest news , ordering online , etc - you can do all these things simultaneously , wherever and whenever you want .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Furthermore mobile phones allow last - minute - changes very easily .
A 1 1|||M:PUNCT|||,|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S No need to make a fixed appointment with a friend in advance , as you can always agree to call each other once everyone is on the way .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , the biggest strength of the mobile phone is also the biggest risk in my opinion : being connected all the time creates a lot of stress for people , as you are always available for everyone .
A 14 14|||M:PUNCT|||,|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore you do n't have any time to relax , which is essential , even from your leisure duties .
A 1 1|||M:PUNCT|||,|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The same is valid for business life : if employees are available all the time , they take the worries of the daily business with them to their home which means a lot of stress .
A 29 29|||M:PUNCT|||,|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Last but not least , the mobile phone enables worried parents or suspicious partners to track the child or the loved one nearly permanently .

S For instance , it is really motivating for students to use technology in the classrooms .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Apart from that , I strongly believe that technology can be incorporated in the classroom , but teachers and schools are the ones who have to control this activity so that it can be positive both for students and teachers in order to make the learning process more motivating and effective .

S All in all , I think that schools should not stop taking into account this important subject .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Many people have the impression that learning a language is only possible through hard work : studying grammar rules , learning vocabulary by heart and burying your head in a book .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , there are in fact several methods that you can employ should you want to become a linguist .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In this essay I will discuss two of these : the immersion method , and the classroom method .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , the immersion method takes its inspiration from the way in which we all learnt to speak our nature tongue : implicitly .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S With this method , learners are simply exposed to the target language , either by going abroad to live in the country where it is spoken , or by having a native teacher .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There is no explicit focus on grammar ; instead , the learners are expected to " absorb " the language and its rules .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This method has its advantages , as it is the way we all learnt to speak , and so it is arguably more natural .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another advantage is that students are unencumbered by overcomplicated , confusing metalanguage .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Secondly , the classroom method is the one with which most students ( especially if they are older ) are familiar .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Learners are normally taught in their mother tongue , and are given grammar rules , which they then apply to the language they are learning .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This method also has its benefits , not least logistically speaking , since many students do n't have access to native speakers or are not able to travel abroad .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S While both methods clearly have their advantages , I believe that just limiting students to either one or the other can have a negative effect on language learning .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Having a native speaker will give students maximum exposure to the language , while at the same time a focus on rules will give them the tools for self - correction and self - study .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The structure is pretty much the same as the pellet stove , the difference is that instead of a fan here we have a pump due to the fact that the goal of the boiler is to warm up water and send it to the heaters all over the house , so it 's nedded a pump to do that instead of just a fan ( the pourpose of a fan and a pump it 's the same : move fluid from a point A to a pont B , but in one case you have to move air and in the second case water ( they have a different density : water has 1000 times the density of air ) .
