My town is a medium size city with eighty thousand inhabitants .
It has a high density population because its small territory .
Despite of it is an industrial city , there are many shops and department stores .
I recommend visiting the artificial lake in the certer of the city which is surrounded by a park .
Pasteries are very common and most of them offer the special dessert from the city .
There are a comercial zone along the widest street of the city where you can find all kind of establishments : banks , bars , chemists , cinemas , pet shops , restaurants , fast food restaurants , groceries , travel agencies , supermarkets and others .
Most of the shops have sales and offers at least three months of the year : January , June and August .
The quality of the products and services are quite good , because there are a huge competition , however I suggest you taking care about some fakes or cheats .
Everyone has his own plans .
People want to be a doctor , other want to be a teacher .
I have my own plan too but I do n't same to them , I want to become a Journalist .
Working as a Journalist is very exciting because many reasons .
First , I will have an opportunity to live abroad .
Second , I can travel all around the world , meet different people who are very friendly .
Next , I will have a chance appear in big parties or events and I can make friends with famous person - It 's interesting !
Finally , I will have high salary when I am Journalist .
To be Journalist , I must study very hard so I 'll try to learn in order to make my dream comes true .
In the future , I 'll become a journalist .
Now days each family has more then 1 car for each one , this is only one of few reason that people use less public transport .
Before was really convenient to go by bus or by train but with the new economy the travel tickets are more expensive and a big difference from the past is that it is less expensive to go far then near .
I remember from my town Palermo in Italy to go to Milan was about 340 pounds , now if we are lucky we can arrive to New York .
In England where I live , in Bedford , we use a lot the train to go in the most important town of UK , but the train are very expensive , me and my family stay careful if we go off pick because the price are to high .
I 'm sure in the future there will be car able to fly or you can park them in your pocket .
Furthermore , the biggest group of positive feeling students in the present is live with various nationalities .
The possible reason is these international students can not speak English flowing .
They usually lack of language and can not open a debate .
It is restrict to argue .
In the other side , they might be wanted to safeguard national image .
In order to give a good image and show the national parenting , our respondents tend to have a great pardon to other nationalities .
MORE THAN KIP FIT !
Do you know mountain biking ?
Perhaps you think it 's only a sport .
You 're wrong .
Follow reading to know why!.
I 'm keen on mountain biking since three years ago .
Firstly , I tried with a rental bike in the area of Aznalcazar .
The main reason why I wanted to prove was to lose weight ( I was a bit overweight ) .
However , it was wonderful how I could admire the landscape while I was doing sport .
Consequently , I realized that although ciclyng outside helped me to improve my fitness , really I enjoyed the best breathing pure air and taking pleasure the countryside .
If someone wants to take up this sport , first of all , I would recommended him or her to pursue a good mountain bike .
It 's important to avoid accidents , become comfortable and have a good journey .
Secondly , he or she would buy a good helmet and , of course , appropriate clothing .
I love this sport . I look forward to the weakened , to go out with my bike and my group of friends .
All of us spend a good time .
And I would like to encourage everybody to prove .
Nobody wo n't regret it .
Lucy Keyes
Lucy Keyes was the last thriller I 've seen .
I do n't recommend it to children lower than thirteen years old ,
because it 's difficult to understand ; for example , the characters are ,
Lucy , Molly , and their parents , a cowboy , and a teacher .
The movie is about Lucy 's family that moves into a farmhouse , mysterious and
scary .
Also reflects a comparison of Lucy 's family , and characters
from a story their mom read often .
The story actually takes place in a camp , and farmhouse , mysteriously
used in other times .
It 's interesting because Lucy 's mom discovered a wall in their farm , that
had a weird painting of two sisters just like her 's , the same ones also of the
story she read .
I recommend this movie only to teenagers older than thirteen years old ..
The best place for young people in our aree is without doubt the lake .
Here they can do many kinds of sport : swimming , sailing , surfing , kiting , rowing and many others .
At least they can meet other folks and relax , have a sunbathe and listen to the music .
In the summer around the lake are so many concerts so you have the difficulty finding the right one .
Luckily the scouls are closed per ten weeks so the young girls and boys have much time to spend the
leisure time together .
Dear husband ,
I hope you 're fine .
I remember all of you and miss my family .
Leaving my country , Soamlia , was very hard for me .
I miss my big house but I do n't miss the guns .
I hope to return to my country and see you again .
In the following decades revolution and civil smote many of the Powers of Europe , and new nations were born .
Britain alone escaped almost unscathed from these years of unrest .
There was an unparalleled expansion of the English - Speaking Peoples both by birth and emigration .
I really like to travel , but I like the most when I travel with friends .
I a very good experience .
I love to travel with my family .
is different to tavel with friends that travel with family .
I do not travel too much with my friends .
I just have had traveled two times .
Those two times has been with the orchestra that I play .
Once we went to Zacatecas .
We went there because the university orchestra from UAZ invited us to go there and play with them .
In that time I did not know nobody , just one .
Her name is irixhi .
She was my friend , because we are from the same town .
But when I was there I began to make new friends that I never thougth I was going to have , and I never thoungth the way that I was going to know them eather . at the begining I felt very strange talking with them , but now we are very good friends .
We stayed in Zacatecas like a week we really had a good time .
The second trip that I made was to Guerrero .
We went to play to Acapulco , to an event that unuversities from Mexico go and present like cultural activities .
There was too hot .
In Acapulco I had a good time because I stay in the same room that my friends and we swam a lot and we really had fun .
Then we went to Taxco .
There we visit the central park and we stay in a very luxury hotel .
We were very happy there we really like Taxco .
Actually I was already been there before but not with my friends .
Then we went to Cacahuamilpa to play there that was an incledible experience that I will never forget .
then we return to Toluca to continue with my boring life .
And now I have to pass my subjects .
We hope to go to Colombia next year .
I like biathlon .
Really , I think it 's a very beautiful , interesting and breathtaking kind of sport .
In biathlon sportsmen need to run some races , which a very different , some of that are long , some are short .
But , short distance does n't mean it 's will be easy or something like that .
Sometimes weather conditions are not comfortable for guys , for example : wind , light frog or freeze , all of that are very difficult conditions .
So , it 's not so easy like it seems .
That 's why I like it .
This sport are for real men .
And also most of them are very attractive , big advantage for girls , whose like nice pictures .
There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
That is what everyone say when we ask if they prefer public transport or car .
Using public transport can be not easy , because we have a strict time and normally we do not have a place to sit and that can be extremely desconfortable .
Sometimes the employers do strike and we clients do not known in time as a result we can not get on time to work , that is one of the disadvantages of using public transport .
One argument for not using the car is that the petrol price is very expensive , but the public transport tickets are also increasing , so that advantange are not so good actually .
For me car is the best and you ?
Well however your choice is , it is necessary to be perfect for your daily life !
However you use Have a nice trip !
People usually tell me I 'm a cinema 's enthusiast , and they are in the correct way . I prefer to spend my free time watching a good film especially when it is a thriller than doing sport ,
If you want to see a good thriller , " Regression " will be your best option . I have seen it recently and in my opinion , it should be seen by everyone because I believe people would like it for many reasons .
First of all , the director , who was Alejandro Amenábar , did a great job due to that , the spectators were waiting with bated breath as the final of this film will be .
Secondly , the actors were fantastic and the main character , which was performed by Emma Watson ( who is really hilarious ) , was amazing .
What 's more , the plot is easy in order to understand .
The history took place in the USA a few years ago when the regression method was accepted by the doctors and cientifics .
Moreover , customs , make - up and special effects became ever more in reality the story .
However , the soundtrack was awful , it did n't get having a scared .
In conclusion , my recommendation for the student film club is this fabulous and exciting thiller must be seen if you had spent a good time given than it achieves keeping in suspense until the end and it does n't be afraid .
In addition , you wo n't have better opportunity to see it than this week , because just moment in Spain the festival 's cinema is happening .
You should take advantage of that !
In my opinion , public transport in my country will never improve because my country is so poor and beside it is considered one of third world countries and another think must be taken into consideration is they the politicians are horrible they have destroyed my country
When we ask ourselves , how can we take care of the environment ?
The first thing that we think is the pollution , the car smoke , factory smoke , etc ... but , have we thought in the food or clothes ?
perhaps when we are buying in the supermarket or other shops we are doing something bad , because we ask to assistant a bag o similar to carry at home this food or other things .
We can take a bag from our house , because if we do this every time that we are going to buy in each shop , we do n't spend more piece of plastic or paper .
But we do n't have forgotten the cotamination by cars , We can use more the bicycle or public transportetion .
Also in the sort way , we should go walking to the destination.icle
If we are working with sameone in the same jobs , and who lives near or he is our neighbour , we can go to the work in the same car , this way we use less oil .
The governents are also important for taking care of the environment .
They should have healthy habits and with their examples they can improve the habits of the population .
I love sports but I did not get much opportunities to play a sport . I born in a village in India , my parents are farmers like most of other villagers .
The only play ground in our village was the school ground which was full of small rock and not good to play any sports .
When I was a child I help my father on his jobs after my school .
We bought television in 1888 , after that I became a fan of cricket .
I was watching most of the matches .
Sachin and Ganguly was my favorite cricketers , I love their batting .
A MISTAKE
It was summer holidays and Michael 's family was in the airport waiting impatiently their flight to Mexico .
That was a special family it was so big ; his father has 6 brothers ! , so he has 17 cousins counting his little sister .
In total they were 32 pelople , a white kittie and a dog .
About 10 minutes later they started to get bored , they heard a girl calling they to enter the plane .
The flight to Mexico was incredible , and very funny .
Michael used to have a great time with his cousins , except with Tom .
That was because Tom liked to give orders to everyone , and Michel did n't liked that .
When the big family get out of the plane , they realize that they were wearing too much clothes , it was boiling ! !
There they took a taxi to the hotel , and at 4 pm .
the family was walking around the luxurious hotel .
SOme minutes later they designate how the cousins were going to share the rooms .
Michael finally ended with the last one he would like to ; Tom .
That night , the dog , the kittie , Tom and Michel slept in the same room , and that was n't too bad .
When Michael get up in the morning , he realize that his kittie had disapeared , and he found Tom 's dog with some white hair in his mouth .
He thought that the dog had eaten the kittie during the night , so he shouted to Tom , open the door and went away .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake
One of the best restaurants I 've ever been to is Spizharka .
It is situated in the very centre of our city and offers a wide variety of dishes and drinks .
The service is really great .
The waitresses are helpful and smiling .
You feel like you are at home !
Warm candle light and small tables with patterned table clothes create friendly atmosphere .
The dishes are n't very expensive .
i believe it is suitable for our class
So , my favourite sport in the present time it is street workout . I have been exercising this sport already long time .
I like to exercise on the street even in the season when the temperature outside below zero .
Of course , in summer I like to exercise more than in winter but this do n't stop me .
I do n't know myself why , but I almost every day go on the street in order to exercise .
If It is very coldly and windily outside , I do n't worry about it and I 'm exsercising at home .
For those people , who want to start to exercise the street workout I 'm advising to start with basic exerscises such as pull ups , push ups , dips and squats .
That everything basic exercises and they will help you will do a good start up .
After some time when you will be feeling that you are ready for more , you can start to study more difficult exercises .
So , it 's my first attempt to create English text !
I dare say what I was quite self - confident a few months ago .
But now not .
What 's the reason ?
Because of mind .
I was n't satisfied with your behavior .
Sometimes , a lot of phrases and sentences runs in my head , but how to write it down correctly ?
How can I use to use it ?
How can I force my kids to do his homework ?
How can I explain them ?
Michael is a handsome and kind person .
He lives next to his family 's home .
Michael got married his close friend since only one month .
But his mother hate his wife and always shout at her .
Unlike his wife respect and love his mother and never complain to her husband these bad situations .
Michael 's only fault that he is a mamma 's boy .
For he always defend his mother and always the wife is the responsible one .
His wife decided , because she loves him , to forgive and apologize for her mother - in - law .
One day when Michael was out for work , his mother insulted and hit his wife .
Moreover she fired her without her mobile or money .
His wife was sad and she cried a lot and she stood on street waiting for Michael .
Once he came , his mother asked him to up quickly acting that she was tired .
He saw his wife but said no words to her and continued hi way .
His wife walked behind him until they reach home but his mother claimed that his wife told her cruel words and acted that she was crying .
Michael believed his mother although he observed marks of hitting on his wife 's shape .
He fired his wife after insulting her .
She was shocked and apologized about a mistake she did not commit .
But his mother refused her apology and ordered him to close the door .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
The light bulb .
The light bulb was created on 1879 by Thomas Alva Edison .
This was one of the everyday invents that affects our lives .
Edison said to created the first comercially practical incandescent light .
He was neither the first nor the only person trying to invent an incandescent light bulb .
Some historians claim there were 20 over inventors of incandescent lamps prior to Edison 's version but Edison is often credited with the invention because his version was able to outstrip the earlier versions because of a combination of three factors : " an effective incandescent material , a higher vacuum than others were able to achieve and a high resistance that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable . "
( taken from www.bulbs.com )
Edison began a serious research about the incandescent light bulb on October of 1878 , and his original design were in 1879 .
Edison and his research team did his discovery comercialy and create a company called " Edison Electric Light Company " .
I think what this is the most useful invention because without this we ca n't live like we live actually .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Tom friend of Peter suddenly fainted fell down in the class room I do n't know what to do immediately , first calm down yourself and I checked his pulse beat it is okay , then I knew that he is out of danger so I called my classmates everyone rushing to the spot but still he is not moving so we decide to take him into the hospital or call the ambulance , finally we call the ambulance without ant delay .
Everyone eagerly waiting for the ambulance arrival but still not yet reached the reason is our college location is little far from the city that 's why it is getting late .
We were waiting patiently , finally the ambulance arrived and take him into the hospital immediately .
Lately I have seen a very interesting announcement in International Sports Monthly magazine .
I was interested if I could write such an article and win a prize .
And I decided to try .
Nowadays healthy way of life is very popular with most people all over the world .
And as for me I 've been going in for sport for several years .
What is my favourite kind of sport ?
It 's ordinary bodybuilding .
Why did I choose it ?
I want to be fit and have a good health .
I lost several kilos and I could wear my favourite clothes .
It became possible for me to run easily .
I 'd like to give advice to everybody not to sit at home and watch TV .
Go to sports gyms , be active and you will feel in another way .
You will forget about doctors and expensive medicine .
Sport is like drugs .
If you do n't have training for a long time your body will feel something unusual .
Your muscles will be strong and you 'll be able to fulfil any difficult job .
People will look at your figure enviously .
Describe your bedroom .
My bedroom is quite big .
The wall of my bedroom are white and the floor is dark grey .
In my bedroom there is a brown bed , a yellow drowers , a little light brown bedside table and a big brown wardrobe .
On the wall there are some pictures of my family , but I do n't nave any posters .
I am living at São Carlos , in the countryside of São Paulo , from Brazil .
In my city the environment 's protection is so difficult .
First of all , we have an extinction area of cerrado closer to Federal University of São Carlos , but sometimes , the area will be used to construct a new building of University .
We have done several movements , but sometimes is not worked .
Secondly , the Hall does n't matter with the environment ; for example , the Hall stopped with garbage 's selection collection when the new major assumeded the hall .
It demonstrate the effort was done in the last 10 years it was over because the new political position of the major .
It is so stupid because the environment need to be over then political position .
Third , we have not founded a green political to eliminate rubbish .
Instead to use a selective collection of garbage , or recycling of materials , or the sanitary landfill ; we have used the dumpfill that is prejudice the soil .
At last , the population , in majority of the times , does n't matter to throw away the garbage on the street or in a prohibited area .
In conclusion , in my city , the concern of the environment 's protection do not working how it is necessary to protection of soil , environment and healthy .
Environment is the sorrounding.there is no aleartness in our locality.they were busy in their own work.everyone were not focus or see what hapening in our place.they use to speak about how hot today is?but they do nt know what makes this much hot.iam interest in planting tree and makes sorrounding clean.some people used to burn forest as if those forest is useless.man are greedy because of all the thing getting from the forest are free .
They damcare about environment because that does n't gave anything to them .
Managemant acountant practice is very important for organization to making decision about human resources , sales , marketing and potential customers .
Most of the organizations known how is affect managemant acountant practice on them work , therefore they are chossing good programme and employee .
I have been in the USA last year , first in order to look for a job as a pharmacist but also , having a lot of time to explore a new world .
I spent about two years there , but I wanted to come back to Italy because I missed my home .
At first , I had called a travel agent but he said he could n't be able to book me a flight before two months , so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip and he promised me he would have booked a flight sooner than that good for nothing agent .
I believed in him , but I did n't know how I was wrong .
He had booked me the flight but he did n't pay for it , because in that moment he had n't got cash enough on him .
The worst thing was to find it out at the airport .
I had never felt so nervous !
Environment is always a hurting problem in the world .
There are company so much , they make our life polluted .
To take care of the environment , each of us has to do anything such as propaganda to the people in the country, ... about my village , we use banana leaf stead of nilon , garbage desposal sensibly ... and so on .
we should clean our area to attract visitor and introduce to many other countries in the world.let protect our lung

This summer happened to me several things , I went to the beach , I went to the pool , or simply went for a walk with friends , but the best was when I went to a wedding because it was the event that more memories bring me this summer .
We got there at five o'clock , we had not yet reached many people , so take the opportunity to give the gift that was a washing machine the finished clothing to reach the store , and apparently they were in need of a new , as the bride loved .
Spent half an hour after we arrived , started coming everybody , there were many greetings , thanks , hugs , kisses , and then we all went to the table , which was magnificently structured , plenty of food of all kinds , drinks , but we were all waiting for the main course , also the food was magnificent , but the best part was when the couple went to the pool , we were lucky we had an amazing wedding planner who arranged the magnificent and fun activities , he said to the bride and groom enter each an inflatable ball and try walking on the water as long as withstand , and the bride won because the groom slipped and fell after them , out of the ball , fell into the water , and kissed .
At four in the morning , after opening the presents , everyone started to leave , it was a long day but a lot of fun , but it could have lasted a bit longer .
I usually wake up at six o'clock in the morning , then I 'll take a quick shower .
After school , I 'd like to eat fresh fruit .
I am keen to run during the night time .
IN my country peole do alot of mistake and have alot of of bad habits concerning their attitude towards the rubbish , they are always throwing their old things and rubbish in public place , the governement also can not do their role towards their people and their bad behaviour
Once upon a time , there was a monster on the city called " Michenstain " .
Michenstain was a very tiny city that was one bad thing for them ; the other bad thing was that in the city , there was a monster called " Monsteration " .
Monsteration was a very lively monster he always migrates to the north every Monday .
In the day , he was a mild monster , he was very visible ( because he was big ) ; but in the night , it was the contrary , he kill people , destroys complete cities ; he smash all the architecture from the city , and a lot of bad things .
One day , Monsteration 's next destination was the city of Michenstain .
All the people did n't know what that was , so they did n't care about it .
But when he arrived to Michenstain , all the people went : " DAHMMMMMMMMMM " .
It was in the midnight when arrived , so he was eager to destroy everything .
So all the people started to run and scream , and the monster was pursuing all of them .
He was spoiling all the crops from the people , he was destroying all the vehicles , and he destroyed a vast area .
The next day , he was a very attractive monster , in other words , he was convert in other monster body .
He was completely different ; it was impressive the way he was acting .
The thing that he ( the monster ) did n't know about was that he had a spectacular infection ( literally spectacular ) that I thing that it have no cure , it was called " The Monsteration Infectations " .
( On those times there were diverse monster , but none of them was like him ; he was in the number 1 rank of the monster in destroying things . )
The scientists are trying to make a cure for the Monsteration Infectations , but they still do n't have it .
In their laboratory , they have a lot of chemicals that were prohibited in their country , but they used them .
They had to isolate the chemicals to the formula to have the cure .
Some scientists did n't care about the infection ; they were playing ultimate team in their iPods .
The scientists that were doing the formula had a lot of tension , but finally , they did it and they said : " Magnificent " .

If you want to start working out you should be ready for big load on your muscles
On Thursday , September 11 , the term exams finished and our week of vacation started .
In the afternoon I went to my dance classes .
it was fun because we learn a new hip hop dance and we finished our tap dance .
On Friday I went to the mall with my family .
I bought one sweater and two jeans .
Later I went to the book store and bought three books ; " legend " , " wonder " , and " Eleanor & Park " .
On the weekend I stay at home . I start reading " Eleanor & Park " ; it was amazing , I was laughing a lot because the things that the characters said .
The other things I do were sleeping , ate , and watch TV .
The next day I went with my friends to see a movie .
We saw " if I stay " and I loved it .
The movie is about a teenager named Mia that had a car accident with her family .
Her father and her mother died before they arrive to the hospital .
Mia survive but she is in a coma and she have to decide if she wants to live without her mother and father or if she wants to die .
Later in the week I pass the day drawing .
I draw a meadow , a little girl , and a butterfly .
The next days I did n't do much .
I just sleep and watch movies at home .
The day before I start school , I do an investigation for literature class .
This was what I did in my vacations , I did n't do a lot but I loved my vacations .
Hello Jo , my name is Mirko .

Maybe you can bring some money and spend it on something fun .
Best wishes .

As per the today topic " No Future for public transport " , I would like to add comments on that please be patient my English is not too good as you readers think .
So , lets start ,
Most of the Metro cities are now days attract people of city towards Metro only not just because of the fare but because of the time that it saves .
Now these days public would not like to travel in the public Transport to save their time as well as money .
Metro is good for even health of the people as no pollution and all because it runs on electricity and also it connect most of the city as Delhi has a wide area span of Metro that is really awesome .
Other than that public transport is also not good for Natural resources which is not good for the future of the country .
If you visit Taiwan , you will never miss the temples here .
There are so many temples here .
So , now there is a chance for you to pretend the god .
Jiu - Tian Folk Arts Group is a group of people who are good at our traditional performance , which is " imitate the faces and pose as gods " .
In here , they will teach you how to draw the face of god , dance like god , and beat the drum .
Curious ?
Just come and give it a try !
I think pay expensive tax on personal car can reduce the use of cars or other vehicles in order solve the traffic problems .
Because all people like money , for example , many people do n't buy car with expensive tax , so people must use the public transportation , such as bus , subway .
The public transportation will rich , so they can build more station for suburban and more public car to carry this .
Therefore traffic will be batter .

I think public transport is very important .
there is no way to travel from Egypt to the USA using a car .
a plane may take about 16 hours .
a car may take days or months for the same distance .
I really overwhelm to be third member of my small family- Peter , Maria , both of which are my parents in 45 years of the same age and my little brother , Patrick-14 year old in a mischievous manner .
Their gentle norm with lovely and adorable mind take a reference to their hobbies - reading .
Nowadays a person 's worth seems to be judge according to the social status and material possessions , that is mostly to happen in high class famiies , as they are foccus on achievements as power , political influences etc . on the other hand for a middle class families the old - fashioned values are still important as it is the inheritance from our ancestors in terms of values as honesty , kindness , loyalty , etc .
Metro is the most comfortable way of transportation in Moscow .
Metro is only one that I use in the city .
Using a ground transportation is not comfortable because of traffic .
Just a few years ago we started to use a special road line .
But the problem is Russian drivers are not getting used to keep this line free .
Moscow traffic is awful .
Everyone is in a hurry .
There is no difference if you use car or bus .
For example American public transport has a special line and a schedule and it works like a train , I mean come in exact time like a train .
That 's my dream"when I joined the faculty of languages and translation I was very happy because I achieved my dream .
In this faculty I faced some problems with my english , I began to ask " How can I improve my english ? "

One day in October , Michael a boy was studying architecture discovered a box with a message , while he is opening a box , he heard a door .
In this moment a big man went into the bedroom .
This man was his father , who had dead .
Michael was very nervous and confused because he did n't understand anything .
He spoke with his father and he asked him because he was there and his father responded that he had the biggest secret about his family .
" In the past Matilde your mother killed your brother , although she had a reason , he was a monster because he killed a lot of people in our city , so we went to another city . "
But Michael did not believe this story and he thought that he was crazy .
This situation was impossible because his father had dead and in this moment he ran and he opened the door and his father said you must be here because I must speak with you more time and explain because I can speak with you but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .

How are you ?
Today we received a shipment from Visual service center under our old account number , it could be a mistake by service center as a notice regarding major organizational restructure already sent to service centers .
In issued notice it clearly states that all defect parts should be sent to Slovakia with effect from 01/06/2015 .
If any more shipments are returned using our old TNT account number , there is no option other than invoicing service center for not following instructions .
So please advise all service centers to return defect parts to Slovakia instead of England .
Nowadays , sport is very important part our life .
Many doctors recommended the practice of sport , because it is very healthy for our body and for mind .
Every day , there are many articles and news information that talking about the benefits that you get if you practise sport .
My favourite sport is swimming because as soon as start this sport you feel better .
In spite of you do n't lost weight , you can win endurance and flexibility .
When I am stay in water I feel free and very hastily .
Not only is sport when you feel sweaty , but also you do a lot of exercise .
However , you do n't have the feeling that you are very tired , is different , at the same time is fantastic !
On the one hand , my advice that I would give to someone starting my favourite sport , swimming , is that you need a little will power because sometimes , for example in winter , you will not want to go to the gym , let alone you get in a pool !
On the other hand , my other advice is that I am very sure that you will feel wonderful and happy!May be not at first time , but sure later .
I promise you that it will be this way .
In conclusion , sport is very necessary and useful for you can improve your life .
You start and then you explain to me how are you ?

Public transport have improved the regional development since the past decade , it 's convenient and necessary for a city life .
But when it comes to travel , it 'll be more convenient if you have a car , because you will not like to go where everybody goes .
If you have a car , you can go anywhere you want and stop by any beautiful spot you like .
It 's more flexible for your travel plan .
And , it 's really enough development in our planet , it would be better if we can leave some place blanked , we do n't need so much convenient transportation , and we can still live well .
Save some nature to the earth , and leave clear air for our kids .
Build public transport in a city , not in a country .
My favorite sport game is Cricket .
It is very important and very enjoyable game .
Today cricket is very famous game in the world .
Among them cricket is very famous in Sri Lanka .
We could go to in the world from cricket .
It is very great .
Today we have clever cricketers and famous amperes than other countries .
It is very valuable .
Australia , England , South Africa and New Zealand are very famous country for cricket game .
But those countries are very developed and they have any facilities .
But Sri Lanka is developing country yet .
They have no facilities than other countries .
But Sri Lanka cricket team could won the World cup 2014 .
It is very important opportunities in our countries .
So as I think I can enjoy in cricket than other games .
You can start the cricket game .
And you can earn more money and you can go to other countries .
Today we have lots of sports games .
Volley ball , Net ball , Elle , Table tennis , Karate , etc .
But it is not famous and we could n't go to in the world .
But cricket is very famous and we know any cricketers .
We can be a famous and earn more money .
Cricket is good for our health than other games .
In my opinion cricket is best for you . You can be a good cricketer .
You do not what to do ?
Are you a tourist ?
Are you lost in the city without knowing what to do ?
If I am right continou reading this .
We have a lot of shopping facilities , it is the good thing about living in a big city like Madrid , because we have a lot of different shops since clothes shops , pets shops , food shops , shoes shops , accessories shops , toys shops , presents shops and much more types of shops that know I can not remember , but you can find almost all you want or you need it is not incredible ?
But for some of them you have to search very well because some of the shops are unique and some other are very good hidden , but for that you have specialized transports that will take you to wherever you want or you need to go
Hi ,

It was such a great experience for me .
I applied in one music club in our city and I was really excited when they repplied and asked me to help because I enjoy going to rock concerts and I was truly curious about how the backstage is working .
What was mny job ?
Mostly I helped others an carried the stuff .
I enjoyed working with a soundmaster so far .
It was quite stressful but at the end of the concert the atmosphere was amazing .
People were singing and shouting - they all seem to be really happy .
I hope I will do that again once .
See you arrond

Hi Jo ,
It 's really nice that you are asking me about it .
Poland is really beautiful and you choose it wisely .
I suggest that you can start your trip from Warsaw .
It 's heart of Poland and you will learn everything about work , education and people from here .
Every big city in Poland is very similar to each other .
If you want to relax you can also go to mountains or sea .
Even there you can meet really nice people and talk with them .
But let 's talk about work there .
We appreciate kind and hard working people .
But you ca n't expect that they are going to pay you a lot of money .
Rate is pretty low .
But there is a chance that you can meet generous people .
Take care
Ola

I am very well and everything is all right .
Well , I write to tell about my last summer .

This summer was really great .
I recommend you to try this kind of job in case you want to earn extra money and also meet new people .

In this essay I would like to highlight how a wide range of public transport can help people to save a bit of money and a lot of stressful hours stuck in the traffic jam .
Firstly as everybody know the cost of the fuel is increasing more and more , adding to those the bill that own a car will bring , it became immediately clear that it is cheaper go around by public transport .
Why then there still be so many people who prefer to drive their own car instead of seat comfortably on the train or on the tube reading their favorite book on their way to work ?
I would say that this is because the public transport are not so efficient as the should do .
In my town for example , I have been Waiting for up to forty minutes before I could take a bus .
I strongly believe that it is a shame because a lot of people like me would live their vehicles at home and take a train instead .
Secondly , the environment would improve its state indeed , as far as I can see the pollution caused by the traffic is ruining monuments and making the air dirty and heavy , the same is as far as waste of time is concerned , obviously the fewer cars are around the quicker you can get where you want .
In conclusion I would really like that politicians who care about public transport will improve the services so that more people could leave their vehicles at home and move around much more easily .
The problem is that if everyone thinks that traveling by car is convenient , absolutely everyone will go everywhere by car , and the roads will become chockablock .
You see man , I do n't like crowded roads , a nd prefere to travel by tram .
It is cheap and eloquence .
I play basketball on weekends since I am little .
I also like to play baseball , too .
I can play basketball and baseball like no tomorrow .
I usually play baseball with a group of my friends .
I play with them on the playground .
I ca n't image the life without sports .
In the today society .
The most people are travelling by their car , because the public transport was not convenient for people to use .
Maybe , in fact the lands are more big , so that the transport had not published to anywhere .
The general transport constructions can divided three levels .
On the lands , the railroad and highway is the go through the most city roads .
In the sea , include the route and port construction .
In the sky , include airplane flights and airport construction .
The transport construction and economic development has a close relationship , and utilized of land are more important .
The development of the railroad and highway are easy to pulished , but construc of seaport and airport must with congenital condition .
When integrate of the economy and land planning are accomplished , the public transport constrcutions are convenient for people to use .
I am going to write about how live is going to change in the next 50 years .
Although we do n't realised we have to be conscious
that every day is a different day if we compare with the one has passed .
Some years ago we did n't use the technology to get in touch with friends and family but nowadays it 's the most important thing for
some people who they ca n't live without it .
I am speaking about the mobile how it changed our life .
It 's normal
that in the next 50 years it is going to change .
It will be more advantages in general and it will give us a lot of good things but maybe some bad things too .
To sum up , although we do n't want that our life changed it is normal that it will have different changes .
It is necessary for our lives to have or to feel that we are getting better .
My favourite sport is chess because it is the only game for our mind .
It also helps us in studies .
I agree that it 's not physical exercise but a mental one .
There are many physical exercises like swimming but name any game except chess that makes our mind sharp .
I like many other games but the best one is this .
I am not saying that we should always play chess as physical activities are also important .
The reason why I would advise someone this sport is that the children who are not interested in there studies or would not be able to study .
In that case chess would help him .It would make child mind sharp and he would not get distract by the surroundings .
Local transportation is one of the most problem in our area .
The local transportation become difficult and expensive .
so the government must take an action to make it easy .
Public media also must educate people the importance of Local translation and how they preserve it .
The Government must save the gasoline and jazz to resolve the problem .
they must find a solution to this difficult problem .
They must maintain roads .
People also have an important role to solve this problem .
They should reserve the energy by using bus instead of using their own cars .
They also can walk or ride a cycle .
Government must maintain the public transportation and make it safe .
We can solve this problem if we want that .
I have thought that writing an article on my favourite sport would be interesting for the readers , above all , and making no differences on the sport you have chosen , it is paramount practising some sport , whatever you choose , such as spinning , that is my favourite sport .
My piece of advice to take up a hobby , in this case a physical hobby , which is interesting for your health .
I rather enjoy spinning , feeling the rhythmn of the music lowder and lowder , this gives me high energy each time I went spinning .
If you want to start practising some sport , first of all think about how much time you are willing to spend on it , then try once and if you are having a good time go ahead and do the most of your time enjoying sport , nevertheless , be careful and go slowly because you might be injured .
the more sport you practise the better you feel , indeed , your mood would not be blue anymore and your body will be thin and gorgeous .
First of all , my opinion is that there is a future for the public transport systems .
If we take a look on the Swiss public transport system , in the bigger cities almost all people go to work by public transport .
The advantage they get is the following : They dont't have to look for parking possibilities , they can leave the bus or the train and a few minutes after they can begin to work .
These people also help to protect the environment by saving our natural resources like petrol .
To conclure , in bigger cities like Bern or Zurich there are no doubts that the public transport system would be less convenient than travelling by car .
The process how to make the notes for the bank can be outlined in six consecutive steps .
First , the bank notes should be considerated how to design included background colour , artwork and security issues .
Then , they are supposed to prepare a skiled machinists .
Subsequently , the sheets of bank notes are printed on the metal plates .
The notes have special link with colour on both sides , which raised images slightly .
The most important step is inspect the notes which are good quality sheets and which are bad sheets .
If the sheets are good , those sheets are then cut into separately and packed into cars in order to dispatach all over the city .
If the sheets are bad , those sheets are then destroyed through burning .
Sport is very important part of a healthy lifestyle .
It keeps our body strong .
Today we have a lot of different sports , so we can choose something that really fits ourselves .
I enjoy running .
It is a kind of thing that everybody can do and it effects all parts of my body .
I literally feel myself stronger after every time I run .
There is no doubt that traffic adds to pollution .
The public transport offers a possible solution for the problem , because much people can transported in one vehicle .
The government has a responsibility to encourage the public to use buses and the underground more .
However , there are a number of changes that need to be considered .
Firstly , public transport should be made free .
The government should raise taxes for pay for the service .
Cars are generally more expensive .
First , I think the public transport is more expensive .
And if we compare the money you spend with the car and the amount that you spend with the public transport , it is less .
Secondly , if you use the car , you haven't wait much time ti catch the bus or the train , and maybe you can arrive later at your job , for this situation .
I believe that use your car has a lot of advantages or benefits , it is more comfartable and less expensive .
last summer i worked at cinema.i think it is a very good job because you can see any films you like for free .
The minus of this work is very big salary and i think that i will work at this cinema on the next summer .
My favourite sport is doing yoga .
I do yoga to aid relaxation .
Yoga calms und vitalizes body and mind .
I do yoga at least one hour every day .
From Monday to Friday I do it at home , at weekends I attend yoga classes .
Yoga is a very convenient sport .
We can do it at any time as we like .
But if you are beginner , it 's better for you to attend regular yoga classes .
You can learn correct Postures in classes .
After doing it skillfully , you can do it at home or any place .
People 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years , Equipment and tools have evolved since the beginning of human history .
In recent decades , however , developments have been particularly groundbreaking , Man has been able to invent machines , which they have been put to work automation is a great help to mankind , because it significantly increases the standard of living and frees people form hard work .
The result is much less work and a better life .
The disadvantage , however , is that because of the machines many people have lost their jobs
Dear Jo
I read your letter , I would like to know some details about what places do you want to visit .
I advise you to visit Queretaro it has had an excellent service with foreign people since five years ago .
Talking about your new job , I was searching some vacancies however it required a job for full - time , so I am going to continue searching some jobs of part - time .
See you when you arrive at Mexico City
Sincerely

Nowadays people get around constantly .
It 's better use public transport or private transport ?
Well , ecologists say that get around using transport public is more beneficial for the environment than using the car or motorbike .
In recent years the numbers of people who use public transport has increased a lot , in comparison with ten years ago .
But actually does it has a future ?
It 's more comfortable , faster and preferable than have to run to take the bus , wait the train , etc .
This is a fact which indicates the public transport there is no future in our society .
Other signals are , for example , if you travel by car , you can park the car in front of the place where you want to go .
But if you take the bus , you have to take down in a bus stop , maybe a bit far from where you want to go .
Also it has to say that maybe in the future , technology will create a car that does n't pollute the air , and then , use public transport wo n't be necessary .
yeah i think it 's statement is quite right because every person have car now a days .
transport are are important but car is more reliable for families they went together without waiting for transport .
more flexible with a lot fun with family .
I live in a city named Tangerang it is in Indonesia .
The Indonesia Government itself does n't seem to give a damn about their country 's cleanliness , and the citizen too .
it caused our river some big problems such as disease , unpleasant smell , flood , etc .
i myself , by seeing the river filled with garbage , always seems to be disgusted by the stench and the unpleasant look from the garbage .
And in Tangerang , the air is polluted by Carbon dioxide and the other materials .
And also , after the river , the road in the city is also contaminated by the garbage .
garbage everywhere .
the condition of my country is really critical , I guess .
And the amount of the city 's garden does n't match the amount of the population and pollution in that city .
There are a lot of high - rise building and it provokes flood along the high - rise building 's section .
I wonder if the citizen in my country and town could make a better environment area by throwing garbage on its place and try using an eco - friendly transportation .
And the government , pls do n't be so flabby with your own citizen .
yes , be strict .
I think it 's okay because the purpose of you doing that is to train the citizen to be more responsible for what they did . and , I think it 's enough from me .
I suppose , the government also have studied this situation too .
But they did n't do that much after knowing this truth .
I hope Indonesian government take an action about this situation because if it continues then Indonesia would be the most unclean country over the other countries .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
She looked like happy and she was looking forward to finishing the class to tell her friend what had happened .
After the class Alison joined her friends .
She was very enthusiastic and telling them that Juan , the boy who she was fallen in love , had written a letter for her .
Then the friends could not left to pay attention in the Alison 's words .
She transcribed the letter with a lot of passion because it was evident that Juan was interested in Alison too .
While all girls was hearding to Alison , Juan appeared as a gosh .
Alison was like tomato and all her friends laughed at her .
The boy felt very embarrassed , therefore he carried on his ways and he did not say nothing to her .
Alison always through : " If I would not have told this story to my friends I had passed all evening with Juan "
I think that for the public transport there is a future , because over time the gasoline prices and the value of the reparations of the vehicles increase .
Like in other things the prices increase , from the aliments to clothes and home supplies , gas , water , eletricity .. Then the people will choose the public transport in the future .
My relaxing activity
Swimming has been always my favourite sport .
I used to go to the swimming pool when I was in the school to learn and it became in my favourite activity when I was really tired .
I was with my sister and my friends and I spent a wonderful moment .
Nowadays , I usually go swimming twice a week and I really enjoy swimming because I can chill out and disconnect my mind .
Moreover , it is said to be healthy in order to improve problems in the back so that going swimming is really beneficial for me .
In recent days I found out a gadget to listen to music while I am swimming and it is marvellous because I also love listening to music .
To begginers in this sport I would recommend that a trainer teaches swimming properly because it is very important to pay attention to the position of the arms .
Furthermore , it is necessary to wear glasses .
Swimming is one of the best sport to practise it is due to require all parts of the body .
For this reason , it is a perfect activity to do sport and enjoy .
There are lots of problems in our life .
For example : Transport .
There are lots of kinds of Transportation as Buses , cars , Subways , Trains or taixs .
May be they are comfortable , teribble , essay , dengerous or avrage .
If you are late , you can use subway because it is faster , safer and cheeper .
Cars and buses become dengerous and make Problem in the street .
My view of eating habits .
Why does our brain think about food every day ?
Why have you fridge in every single home ?
Why ..... ?
Every day people thinking about fresh food , fast food , sweet food and many different types of food , why ?
Are you thinking that emotional eating is your bad habits ?
How often do you open your fridge ?
How many times are you going to shop for some snacks ?
What happened with us .....
I remembered that my childhood was very quite , happy around dinner at grandmother 's house .
Really , I told you that I was like a little bit future girl who has dinner regularly with two portion : soup and meal deal .
So we can started from beginning : firstly , was breakfast which included some cereals with hot milk .
Secondly , was lunch at school like sandwich and some fruit .
After I was in home on dinner time and some dessert .
Could you see how easy and regular life I have got .
My " private menu " included fresh eat like salad , fish , fruit and vegetables - many options healthy food .
Now , I am 28 year old woman who does n't has time for normally dinner because I 'm a very busy .
Today , I wake up at 07.00a.m and catch up some of kind bread with jam , drinks a coffee but more than often just has time for half mug and runs to work .
During a day I have lunch which is from can or order some junky food .
Later , I order take away from Chinese buffet or any pizza .
When weekend coming I have a plan for special dinner which is like home made but do n't have time again .
What happened with my healthy life which I want to have when I was a child ?
Why everything look like more difficult and hard than were before ?
Where is our free time and what are you doing with your lifestyle ?
Ten years showed me that I can do everything for myself if it is enough for me ....
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
She went to the station train and get a ticket to London .
she stayed there and read again the note the address was near to the big ben .
When the train came she smiled and goes up and sit .
She turned her haid and saw him " he was fowling me " she thought"well , I should ask him what are he doing here "
" What are you doing here " ask Alison he looks her but with a bad smile , and turn his head
First of all , finishing high school is a passege of life that indicate the begnin of a new chapter for the students .
Since this moment they will have maturity and responsibility .
Therefore , many of them are not ready for this .
So , a lot of parents and students have the opportunity to travel for a year .
When you are travelling around the world by yourself , you won a bagage of knowledge , culture , discorves and , with all of this , you won personal experencie .
Sometimes , these is able to change a person , making that she or he have a new perception of the world .
However , some students do n't have this opportunity to travel , they start to work .
The job , provides , as well the trip , responsibility and experencie .
It changes in a different way the person too .
The consequences are n't good as the reasons , for instance , they may have the career prejudicate , or they spend so many years travelling that they are old to study in a uniersity .
Beside that , they have differents points of view in many sublects , that is why they may don ' like the fun and the conversation in the social life with the other students .
They can not enjoyed this chapter with oung and fresh thoughts .
Finally , to make a decision to not go in a university when you finish the high school , is n't the easiest action to make .
It is a great dedcision , that bring great consequences and great experencies .
Whatever are the choice , they will have the mark in their lifes forever .
Be careful and choice it well .
Public transport is the backbone of a city .
Usually people use public transport to travel around the city .
If in a city people are using more public transport than their own private vehicle then it will help to protect environment and traffic as well .
But now a days automobile companies are more focused on the improvements of the cars so that the can be more environment friendly and traffic friendly .
Future of public transport will be measure on the basis of advancement of the private vehicle .
Sometime people get offended because of the crowd and the inconvenience caused by some people while using public transport .
But main concern will be technology .
Technology is being more advanced .
A car is being made so Eco friendly and user friendly that it is more
Many people said that at school all the students have to start a sport and frequent that one regularly .
Is not a good idea because some students have to study all the afternoon for other subjects and the free time is very scant .
AAs an example if a student need to recuperate a subject or have to take a good mark , they ca n't go to do a sport because there is no time .
In contrast do a sport is very important because we can make new friends or we can start to take responsibility but the most important thing is that we are always active e our body can get good results .
To sum up , do sports is very important for teenagers to which the body is going to grow and do it regularly is commitment that we should take . in my opinion , however , do a sport mandatory is not educational because we must do a sport with enthusiasm not bothered or for obligation
Dear Sir ,
I 'm writing in regard to the watch Fossil FS4735 , similar to FS4812 but with different colours .
I 've seen it a couple of days ago and I was going to buy it , but it has disappeared from your
products list ( I suppose it has been depleted ) .
However , I wonder if you cold tell me when it
would be available again .
Thank in advice for your information .
Yours faithfully
In my opinion , they are not my friend . If your parents are your friends , you would live in harmony with them .
They will consider you as a indpendent people .
Accrodingly , You take responsibitity for what you done .
However , they are not my friends .
There are some reasons , they are not , are as follows .
First of all , I make my every effort to do my job better , however , they only consider that I waste my time doing wrong thing .
Next , they do n't believe my capability is good .
I do everything but nothing .
Finally , they totally do n't listen to what my point is .
They always look at me like a kid never grow up .
It is ridiculous that my parents do n't believe ability .
I am ovewholemed with grief , living with them .
I can not tolerate their pride and prejudice anymore .
I prefer staying alone to living with them .
People often discuss if TV viewing is useful for the education .
In my opinion to watch TV is actually helpful for learning new things .
There is one argument that shows , that the TV promotes us .
The main reason for this is , that the TV is teaching us , because it is an important medium in our lives .
A good example of this are the many informative news , which we are allowed to get .
This clearly shows that the TV is lecturing .
To sum up , TV viewing is not just entertaining at all ; It definitely is also educating .
Many people argue about the use of TV .
Some of them believe that it can only entertain us while others do believe that it can also educate .
However , I think that TV can do both .
I bet if somebody wants to have some fun he or she can just choose the right Chanel or movie such as comedies , video gags or funny TV shows .
Meanwhile if an individual wants to learn from TV .
TV provides lots of cognitive programs like cooking , taking care of pets , how to eat as well .
For me , I do prefer reality shows that help people how to deal with problems .
football is the most favourite sport in the World .
Was founded by talented athlete in The UK in early 1900.The Sport was becoming very famous since first World Cup was held in Uruguay until the present .
I really enjoy watching and playing football since I was a kid .
There are several reasons of why people really enjoyed soccer so mush .
Nothing is permanent in this world , I 've knew these words from the mouth of my parents and until now it is in my heart that help me to deal with this kind of life .
Sometimes your happy and sometimes you are sad , nor you are success or you are failed , that is the wheel of the life we are taking .
Life is changing very fast as the days on the calendar is going , the flow of life continuously revolving with the world every person have .
Nobody can tell how , when , where and what will happen in the next 50 years of our life .
It depends on how you deal with what you have at the present to be prepared for the forthcoming changes in the future .
There are a lot of factors that could greatly affect on what you will be in the coming 50 years of your life .
But the most vital part for these changes is yourself .
Everybody has the right one for a change but it should be for the betterment and not for the worse .
With the simultaneous growing inventions of technologies , way of living go through with it .
A complicated ways from before , advance technologies made it easy and simple now , what else more could we expect next .
The digital age has been a big problem for musical industry because the news technologies and internet had helped more the musical piracy .
The people already do not buy a CD , simply downloads it
" Piracy is destroying the music industry " as it is a violation of copyright .
It is a shame that a person is working during many moths for after the people want enjoying his work without having to pay , it is literally to steal .
It is like you design a chair and the people to take without paying .
The singers have to adapt and be able to survive piracy , now most their income are the concerts and digital platform like Spotify .
I think that people should be more responsible and respect the work of others so that society evolves in a healthy way and without conflicts .
Today , many people , groups or social movements are disagree with different and mainly aspects of our dominant culture ; for example , the marriage or the age for married , the role of women in the family , the religions , the education and new ways of family and many values .
This perspective of life is inspired by contracultural movements and some people call to these people as " alternative " , but it is each day more common and it let a inclusive and diverse society .
The culture is changing in this way , maybe it can be wonderful for the human freedom .
CHANGES IN COLOMBIAN CULTURE
Eating habit in my country really has changeged in the last ten years .
it 's r is n't clear complety , but I sopuse it depends on chenging habit of life in developing process of our sosiety .
At first and important change is about eating prepared food that is n't healthy usually , its reason probably woman 's life stile that is going to big change in the way that they do n't like staying at home and spend their time to making food , now they prefer to buy prepared good .
The other matter is about our habit to eating food together with our family that were a custom in humanity life not just in our culture , but now because of hard and busy life , we had to eat our meal mostly days of a week .
Now , we forget big dinner table that are fulled with family members .
But a good change of our habit is attention to calery food and healthy food because of get information on internet and another media that are accessible way for all people easily these days .
Tottaly l think changing is ignorable but we can control it to make our life better , specially about food that is most important aspect of ourlife but we do n't pay attention to it enough .
I am a programmer who wants to write about programming languages and skills .
The truth of matter is I think I 'm full of ideas but unfortunately I ca n't describe my knowledge and experiences in English .
However I can write these ideas in my own native language and that 's why I 'm thinking that one day I should be able to write those ideas in English as well .
Dear Sophie , I have just come back from a really exciting few days with my cousin .
That was the best place I had ever been .
we went to New York for four days .
On Thursday , we arrived at 12.15 .
While I was at the bathroom , me cousin was smoking .
When I went back , a policeman asked him not to smoke , so he was angry during the whole flight .
On Friday , we went on an incredible sightseeing but the guide told me not to take pictures because I had to buy them .
On Saturday night , we went to a formal restaurant to eat pasta .
Finally , we departed at 18.45 pm .
I think I will go back next year .
It was a well planned for a holiday .
Michael , together with his two friends , Adam and John decided take a vacation at Pulau Langkawi , Kedah , Malaysia .
They search for tickets flight , rental car , and hotel .
They were too excited and can not wait to go there .
About one month before departure , they search over the internet the places that might get interested in their mind .
There are Padang Matsirat , Cable Car , Mahsuri Tomb , small islands , Duck tour , beaches , shopping centre and the most exciting is to buy chocolates .
One day before going , Michael suddenly having a problem .
He needs to follow his family to the town .
With all his hurt heart , he told his two friends about the matter .
Adam and John was very angry .
They said , they already planned and Michael happily ruined the vacation .
They need to think again about the budget and all of the stuff .
Michael can not stand anymore , he scolded his friends and saying something that anyone do not want to hear .
His mother heard what had happened .
She try to have a slow talk with her son at his room .
She said , money can make everyone hurt if it is not settle down very well .
After all the wise advises , his mother kissed him on his forehead .
Michael try to think again wisely .
He accompany his mother at the end of his room 's door .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
He called back his friends and manage to settle down all the mess up .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately but he forget what he had to do after thinkig he rememebred that he had to visit his grandmother as she was ill and his mother told him that his grandmother wanted to see her doctor and wanted him to take her by his car as adoctor 's clinic far from her house peter decided to go and he drove his car to his grandmother 's house in the next street after he arrived , he saw his grandmother was waiting for him on the front of the street he apologized to her and asked her to come to the car , " never mind " she told and ride the car beside him .
Peter drove his car to the doctor 's clinic and after half an hour he arrived and he and his grandmother go above through the stairs to reach the doctor 's clinic after they arrived they found that they have to stay aperiod of time to take his turn they waited and then their turn came .they entered the doctor and the doctor was very kind he welcomed them and after check peter 's grandmother .
she was very fine
There is a man who is most important for one 's life .
I am not different from that.there is a back stairs influence in my life he is none but my father .
I respect him so much and admire also .
He is my best friend who never hurts me .
He always helps me by giving good advance .
He is an ideal farmer who never and even tells a lie .
His means of livelihood is the simplest .
He always honors the oldest and taught us of avoiding tells a lie.so far as I remember one day he was advising me suddenly a old man entered the conversation and told a foolish speech .
Nevertheless my father did n't tell him arrogantly but he made him know the right thing politely .
he is a fluent speaker .
that 's why I admire him .
Everyone make mistakes , No one say I have not made any mistake in my life .
I have made many mistake I guess .
But is that big problem in our life or small problem or it really does not matter ?
Or do you really regretted what have you done ?
Travelling by car plays an important role in our life .
There are a lot of private transport in the streets .
However travelling by bus or tram never get away from our daily routine . Travelling by bus is not such convenient as getting a car , but you would never know what can happen with your car , where it will stuck or some of other accedient will happen .
Public transport has a timetable .
This fact gives government such opportunity as manage the traffic on the roads , cities or towns streets .
Private transport give us traffic jams , a lot of accidents and stressful situations .
We are getting nervous because we are responsible not only for our life but other people , too .
And also we have to understand that use public transport is cheaper than use a car .
The other side of the problem is ecology .
Why do we think that only convenience can be the main point of using a car ?
What can we say about our ecological consciousness ?
Let 's take a bicycle travelling to our school or job instead of using any public or private transport .
Transport is more important for our life .
Public transport is becoming no future because of travelling by car is more convenient .
Public transport are not suitable for luggage 's .
Travell plan need to depend on public transport time .
It is more fun when we travelling by car .
We can play music or talk anything while we travel in the car
Public transport is more boring .
If there is no Public transport in some area , then we need to hire taxi .
So If we have our car , it is much easier than using transport .
Dear Jo ,
How are you ?
Nice to receive your letter and learn that you will be in Hong Kong this summer .
Hong Kong is wonderful place for shopping , eating and sight - seeing country .
You can taste sea - food in Sai Kung and Abeedeen .
Visiting Big Budda in Lamma Island , watch the beautiful night view in the Peak .
Besides , Hong Kong also has many country parks for hikking .
I am sure that you will love this country !
If you want to find a job for only three months , I suggest you can teach English for summer lesson .
In Hong Kong , most of student would like to take some courses in Summer Holiday .
I will get some information for you if you have interest it .
Write to me if you have fixed your itinerary and looking forward to see you in Hong Kong .
Ta
I think public transport is paramount nowadays , but the future will deliver us some kind of different means of transport , such as the car , yes , a car we have been using all our lives .
But this time will be another story because in order to save time and money we are going to use our own car .
Let me explain my reasons , when you drive your car you can take it from your garage or in the main door of your house and it gets you whatever you want , but on the other hand if you take public transport it will be much more uncomfortable because you must catch the bus in the bus stop ... where is your nearest bus stop ?
Then you must pick the subway to your destination , so that means a waste of time , otherwise is cheaper , but what happens if you do n't have some coins to pay the bus driver ? here comes the problem .
You should look for a shop to exchange your money into coins .
What 's the time , then ?
Obviously you are late to work , even if you have an appointment to make an interview for a job .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
She read a note from her boyfriend Tom .
She must go to a shopping centre because Tom is waiting for her in the shopping centre .
They go to a new film about James Bond .
Alison is very happy because she did not see Tom for two months .
he must study in a different country and they not see each other for months .
Tom is sutding in London .
Alison go to a bus stop and she waiting for a bus .
She can not wait to see Tom .
When she arrived at a shopping centre Tom is already waiting .
They want to spend all evening together .
The lion king is my favourite film .
It is the story about a little lion and his life .
Symba is the main character .
He must began to be the king .
He lives on the wild .
His father saves him of a fight but he died and Symba is sad .
He moves to another place because he did n't want to be on the same place where his father died .
But he knows Timon and Pumba and they get that Symba believe again that life is good .
Then , Symba save to Pumba of a lion and this lion is Nala who is an old friend of Symba .
They return and Symba gets to be the lion king .
I would recommend this film because it is funny , entertaining and you can learn principles .
My name is shousheng and live in Montreal Canada .
Alrough Canada is an English country however in Montreal , the offical language is Freach .
So I do not have opptunity to practical English Because most of my colleagues speak French .
They speak French in the meeting , in the gearm , and in the shopping
My favourite sport is running .
When I have a free time I usually run because I feel really relaxed after that .
I started this sport six years ago and I found myself .
When I stop doing it for a week , I feel that there is something missing and I 'm not in a good shape .
I advise everyone to start this sport .
In the fact , I know it 's very difficult to do it if you give it up .
But it 's very important for your health .
Running will help you burn calories and make you calm and relaxed .
My favourite sport is football .
I like football because it improves my basic skills and my mind does not take that much stress .
Football is really good because it is an active sport .
It is bewildering !
I was inspired by a true ledgend , his name is Edan Hazard .
He plays for Chelsea .
My favourite teams are Chelsea , Man city , Man united , Real madrid and barcelona .
That all I can say . I love football very much
yes we can say that for car is much convenient . but every person could not be afford car .
even that price behind fuel for car .
that 's first fact .
and the second one is that fashion or style of young people who do n't like more go somewhere using a car than bike .
after that last point we can not go everywhere using a car we would like .
that have limitation also there .
might be somany people are liking because there are so many service with it .
but it does not means that public transport is not having future .
that fact behind sense because maintainance of public transport is not responsiblity of traveler .
if we want to count function of public transport because it 's not enough words to say . but public transport is most need service in big city as well as small villeges .
It 's not so hard to find sights to see in such a big city like Moscow , but when you have a wide variety of museums , parks , clubs , you will try to visit only best ones .
Let 's look at the most popular places where tourists prefer spending their free time in Moscow .
I 'm sure i 'll agree that the Red Square is the most popular sight in captial of Russia .
That 's why I suggest starting the journey from this place .
You can get there by metro ( Teatralnaya Station ) .
From the Red Square you can easily see Moscow Kremlin , St. Basils Cathedral , the State Historical Museum and Gum Trading House .
If you are dying of hunger you can have a quick snack at Teremok cafe or have a square meal at the restaurant # 57 , which on the the third floor of the Gum .
I prefer spending my free time in the parks .
Gorky Park is my favorite place for my leisure .
It 's a capital 's central park where you 'll wind lots of interesting affairs .
There are lots of facilities such as sports centre , ping pong club , hire centre etc .
There is an open - air cinema , but it opens only after 10.00 PM .
So , if you want to have a memorable holiday , the capital of Russia is the most attractive place .
My friend 's name is Kadir .
He is from Giresun .
He likes playing mobile phone , playing basketball and reading a book .
He is hobbies listen to music , play computer game , watch the football match and watch TV .
These are my friends hobbies .
I 'd like to talk about my past .
I 'm only fifteen years old but I think I have a heavy past ..
First , I 've always lived in a kind of little flat which is a social logement .
We did n't have a lot of money but I went to a private elementary school .
There were a lot of rich people , maybe we were about ten to one hundred not living in a house .
I had a lot of friends , too much friends ..
At sixth grade , I realized that they did n't really love me , or even like me .
I remember two contrats moments : One day we had to create a team to make an exercise which used brain , they chose me .
Although , another time , we had to create a team for doing sport , and they did n't choose me .
That get to the second problem I had , and stay now : my weight .
They did n't choose me because of my weight .
I was too fat , too much fat .. I looked at my health booklet one month ago , and I saw that I have been overweight since I 'm four years old .
Until sixth grade , I thought I was " normal " , but then all changed ..
Learning English is very important by the future of all .
Is a language that many people speak and known .
Many people start learning English at school .
Later , the people continue in language schools .
Is a difficult language , so , the best option is to go abroad .
In an English speaking country , everyday you learn to live .
People speaking different but with a basic level understand English .
It is difficult to go to a place unknown with different people but is a good experience to learn .
I think if the whole world has only one language would be better .
Everyone could speak and understand .
Not so , therefore , we must study very English .
Because of her suggestions , I learned how to control my temper while I was facing with failures and kept telling myself that was n't a big shame because I had had tried my best .
Thus , I became more mature because I overcame those hard times .
I like walking in the morning every day and I enjoy doing it with my own or with my friends , and because it 's very useful for my health and also it keeps my body healthy and full of energy .
sometimes I feel tired of walking especially in the sunny days with a high temperatures , but that ca n't let me stop doing this sport .
when I 'm walking , that can refresh me all the time and makes me feeling good .
I want to give advice to people who love thing type of sport ; please do not let it go , and do it as you can , because it 's a benefit sport .
Hi , everyone .
its good idea to improve my English writing .
I 'd like to speak the education process in Egypt .
I have just graduated from faculty of law " English division " from two years ago , with very good grade .
The ordinary result of the big effort I had exerted in my university to have good job in my specialization like a lawyer .
But in Egypt no one takes his right you should pay a lot of money to have a job or knowing someone use his authority to appoint you .
So , I intended to get a job in another state like Dubai , I heard jobs there is very good and also the compensation . I have submit my CV in various jobs .
but what is the common reply ?
your qualifications are not satisfied , You must be UK Or USA educated .
Finally , I see that I have very high marks in education but not have the ability to work in the real life because in Egypt there is the worst education .
Thanks .
1 ) I like helping people
2 ) Tom offered to go to the cinema .
3 ) Meryy refused borrowing money .
4 ) Can we afford to purchase a car next year ?
5 ) I look forward to meet you .
6 ) The movie I watched made me cry .
I do not think , it 's easy to do research in India .
Even if once a time , I want to focus on my work they will create one or the other issue to distract me .
I will make my own path , though it will be difficult for me .
But it will be very romantic to be with my girlfriend and fight with the system .
We generally use the word " stress " when we feel that everything seems to have become too much - we are overloaded and wonder whether we really can cope with the pressures placed upon us .
We can change everything hurt us if we need if we have volition
The reasons for stress are more diverse perhaps because we have an exam period , family proplems or because we think in negative way , or we destroyed ourselves in long hours of working and canceld our needs for enough comfortable , and lots of reasons to stress ...
We must get out of the stress quickly before lose ourself because it 's very hurtful period , for example you can read a book , doing sport , play music , eating delicious food , remmeber all the positive thing was took place with you , talk about someone who trust for him , take off every thing make you upset and make you life tiring , go out and eat meal with your best joking friends , and there a lot of you have to do ...
Remmeber the stress is not lasting thing , and you can avoid it
But if you are willing to live in happy life .
Dear Sir
I am writing to complain about the cafe - Lunch menu .
In my opinion the main course needs a lack of improvement .
Firstly , I am a vegetarian and I do n't have much choice of vegetables .
Secondly there are not much variety of dessert mainly fruits and puddings .
There is not much variety of healthy drinks , there not much hot drinks as well .
Some people say that in my college are vegetarian , Muslim , vegan e.c.t and they do not have much variety of food to choose like halal meat and veg and nothing that comes from animals .
It is considered that you change the type of food regularly .
Reduce the fast food that make people obese and not healthy .
It will be better if you gave drinks compared to the weather like whenever its winter we would like a hot drink and if it is summer we would like a chilled drink .
I hope you consider this major problem in the cafe .
Thank you .
Yours faithfully
Dear Mrs Ashby ,
I 'm writing to you regarding of a letter I 've seen on my way home calling for candidates to fill a vacancy in your cafe staff .
As requested , I 'm an English - speaking guy and currently looking for a job that does n't disrupt my studies at college .
For that reason , this job is perfectly suitable for me and , besides , it showed up as a good opportunity for me to improve my incoming helping me paying my bills .
Now I am twenty fiver years old and when I was teenager I lived abroad twice .
The first time in London , for 6 months , and most recently in Berlin , for 8 months .
the movie I 'm going to be reviewing is " the purge "
I actually loved it quite a lot , I just loved all the suspense and the parts they leave you hanging , it 's just way too interesting , the movie is about the american government who annually gives 12 hours where all crime , even murder , is legal , and there are no medical services during that long period of what they call " the purge " and anyone can join it , you can kill whoever you want .
The thing is , some people do n't think it 's ok , and they do n't agree , so they just stay inside and try to survive the night .
The diagrams illustrates the process about producing bank notes .
At the first beginning , bank notes should be well - designed considering the colour matching and artwork including the issues about safety .
After designing , metal plates are supposed to be prepared with the help of experienced machinists .
Then , it comes to the printing step .
Ensuring there is colour on both sides , image is increased gently by a certain type of ink .
Most importantly , before distribution , printed sheets with 50 bank notes per sheet have to be checked whether they are of perfect quality or not .
They can only be packed and distributed when they are with good quality .
In other words , both bad sheets and the ones which are seperated badly need destroying in a safe way which can stop them from going into the market .
That 's how bank notes are produced from paper to the one we can purchase goods in our daily life .
Many people believe that nowdays there is no future in public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient , but others continue with the tought that they do help for example for travelling for long distance .
I believe both are useful .
Firstly , there is plenty of people who ca nt buy a car and so the only option they have is to travel by these transports .
The ticket does nt cost to mutch and it is avaible for the majority of the people at least comparing to buying a car .
Secondly , public transports are more eficent to travel for long distance than cars and people would nt have to purchase combustible .
When people are avaible to tavel to other continents or far away , they may need a plane , wicth is a public transport , to complete the journey because the have tu cross oceans and clomplicated distances that have different landforms .
However , a car is something witch is from the person and he can do wathever he wants and find it in the same way he or she left it , and sometimes public sports are nt left in the best way .
In addiion , you have to share with people you absolutely do nt know and probably wo nt see again .
Consequesntly yo can be stole or get sick .
But , by obseving all these people you can rich yourself with different cultures and manners the other have and incorporate new topics .
To conclude we can establish a middle point .
Public sports are useful but sometimes inconvenient but more cheaper . You can get to know new people and different cultures .
When I was 12 , I went in France for the first time in my life .
That was my first time on holiday in another country that was n't nourth Italy .
I remember i woke up at 6 o'clock for took the train and went to Paris in France .
After 4 hours sat on an uncomfortable seat , we arrived at the train station and then my parents and me went to the hotel .
We fisited a lot of monuments , museums and churces , like the Louvre with the Monalisa by Leonardo Da Vinci .
That week I felt happy and relaxed but I was a little bit sad when we returned in Italy .
I am waiting only to go there another time !
Nowadays my people have their own transport , for example they have cars .
Transport is the best situation for people to can travel around a country .
Without transport people can not go back to work and do something else .
With public transport , is the best way to go to work . Because it is easy to travel .
No need to pay a full amount because they have many people who entered the bus .
Public transport helped us to know our country and improve ours body to move one place to another .
For example , we should walk to go in a place whereas a car can park in the place which we want to go .
It helps us in many difficult ways , if they have a problem we can take a bus and go there .
It will be more appropriate for us .
All village they have a bus - stop where the bus stop to take or leave passengers .
And some bus drive at night to take passengers .
Without it many people will have many difficult to go somewhere or to return home .
However , they have some disadvantages with a public transport , they gave many traffic jam , this is because the bus a large and difficult to control .
If the roads are small , the bus would go in the street .
The bus would not leave the passengers where they want to go , because they have to leave them in the bus - stop .
Day by day the country develop more and more , nowadays they have trains .
Many people travel by train because they arrive more faster than the bus and cheaper in a long run .
The public transport will have many future because some people have no money to buy their own car .
Public transport have help us in many different ways .
It will better if they have public transport .

It is fantastic ! I ca n't wait .

Nowadys using public transport is considered to be the most convenient
way to move around .
It provides citizen the freedom to relax and disconnect while going home or to work .
However , taking your own car is the much more useful .
And for this reason I honestly think it will be the only means of transport in the future .
You also asked about the leisure activities in Spain .
Well , let me tell that there are lots of ways to have a good time there .
For me , the most interesting one is sightseeing around the city and discover its monuments and landmarks .
However , there are also an endless of leisure activities such as going shopping or going to museums , to cinemas or to beautiful parks
If it were not enough , you will be able to enjoy the amazing atmosphere of our nightlife , going to restaurants , to clubs or lounge bars .
In my town people are very educated and very aware of the environment , they know very well that if we take care of the environment then it will useful for us only , so they always take care about the rubbishes and try to clean the village .
Whenever they are going to outside always keeping the plastic bag with them so whatever rubbish thing they will not thrown to the road or outside .
they always keep the rubbish and dust to plastic bag and then they throw to dust bin
D. Perhaps , bilingual school creation might be a good idea of Colombian education improvement , but it will be appropriate to be aware that Colombia actually has public schools with a basic education where English is considered as another academic subject , in contrast with the private ones .
Because a majority of do n't have enough resources to pay for it .
The whole picture conveys us the process of making bank notes .
It depends five main steps which include desigh , preparation of metal plates , printing , inspection , packaging and distraction or disposal depends on whether the fourth step is good or bad .
Above all , the design is the most previous way we should know , which is considered with the background color and artwork .
Secondly , we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinsts .
And the we need printing and inspection .
Eventually , the most essential part comes out , we need significate the quality of the sheets .
If it 's good , packing and distributin whereas the others shoulde be distroyed as well .
In conclusin , the whole part of process is an unreversed schedule .
It cosumemed the power which contained the humanity and machinic .
Nevertheless , in my opinion the most precious of the revolution is the modern security measure through such a muti - developed society .
To begin with is design , we are able to considerate backgroud colour , artwork , and security issues , and then , we are supposed to preparing mental plates , such as skilled and machinists .
Secondly , printing -- including sheetsof bank notes , printed(50 bank notes per sheet).There are some requestion -- colour on both sides , special ink , images slightly raised .
The most important step is inspection that the printed sheets should manually inspected .
If partially damaged sheets exist , the bank notes should separated into good and bad .
In the end , if it is a good sheet , the porcedure is packaging and distribution , including cutting into separate bank notes , packing , dispatching .
If it is a bad sheet , the porcedure is disposal --bad sheetsand bank notes should be securely destroyed .
I do not know from where I can start .
Back in the 40 's , Cairo was considered as one of the cleanest and the friendly environmental city around the world , Even cleanest than Paris or other cities in Europe .
But the time is changes and things are changing with it .
Nowadays , Cairo can be considered as one of - if not the most - the dirtiest city in the world .
Rubbish is everywhere , people finish their food and throw empty bags in the streets instead of holding it until they found a trash .
So , the ugly truth is my country is n't clean and people do nothing towards this .
In this picture there is a man behind a counter in a shop .
There are lots of guns on the wall .
In the right corner there 's a sign which says that in this shop it 's not to been allowed to sell knives .
It is a fact that on the one hand you have the opportunity to buy dangerous weapons nowadays but on the other hand we are unable to manage this situation correctly .
It is true that there are an increase on violence in the past and it is our duty to tell our children that a world without guns are a better world .

I found your web site and this my first try .

Trieste is a little town situated in the nord - east of Italy .
We have diversified harvest like in the rest of the world , not only in the houses but also in every public building .
For example in our school there is the possibility to collect paper and plastic in different boxes .
In the last year some political men have decided to put in order our city , so for example they put again to place the roads .
In the middle of the principal street , that is next to the sea , there is a divider with a lot of flowers and plants .
So the ambiental impact is very attractive .
We have still many problems to solve in our city .
There are n't boxes for rubbish in every condominium , and we haven't the harvest of the dampness that is present in many other towns of Italy .
Another problem is that the citizen of Trieste do n't pay attention at the ambiental problems of their city .
For example , when a man or a woman has ended to smoke he / she throws the earth cigarette not in the right box .
In other countries it would be impossible , because if someone wanted to do this , he 'll receive a bill to pay .
I think it would be important that , not only in the family , but also in the school could be grow a new generaion sensible to ecological problems of the earth .
In this way we can have the possibility to change .
Hi .
Today a lot of people do sports , but all sports are not amused .
It 's great for me write about the sport and health .
When I was child I ususally play with my friends of football .
I sometimes played at break of school in the morning .
This sport was very happier for me but a day I broke my leg and then I never played more of football .
I have to do jogging a few years ago .
I have often finished very tired because I never do sport .
Because in occasions It 's very bored .
Although I do jogging I also do other sport the swimming .
I began practise this sport three years ago when I lost my work .
I usually go two days a veek but the henxt month I am going to go three or four days a week because I hope to be a local competition .
I go swimming a public pool .
The public pool is near my house .
On the one hand This sport is good for my health I stay fit .
On the other hand I have met a lot of people , they are very friendly .
And finally only I tell you that you should do some sport It is good for us life .
See you .
Jerry read the email and decided to go to the shopping centre immediately .
At this moment he had woke up .
He noticed that he is trembling " it was just a dream " - he thought .
He had another week to find a birthday present .
His uncle 's birthday hounding him because he does n't know what he should buy for him .
He already had enquired about this all the family , nobody hasn't idea which would be good enough .
Then he found that he just will go to the fishing shop and request for help shop assistant .
As he thought as he done .
It was great idea !
The man was professional , and gave him accurate pieces of advice .
He had bought the best of all presents .
Uncle Tom was delighted and proud of me .
Off the top of his head he had asked his nephew to go to the fishing together .
Jerry said that he would be privileged .
It emerged that that young boy have a good head for fishing and now they are always go to the fisihng together .
I do n't have a favorite sport .
I practise a lot of sports , and now I 'm going to tell all over them .
I like running , ride my bike , playng football , skiing at winter , climbing , etc .
What I like to run is to go the mountain and enjoy the landscape .
What I like to go bike is doing routes and very long paths .
I like football because it is a sport that I practiced from small and I think that is the team sport more fun and exciting .
I like skiing because it is a sport that I also did from small I like large speeds and lower living at high altitudes and enjoying great landscapes .
I like to climb but it is a sport that I just started ... but I want to keep practising it and keep learning new things .
The issue of taking care of the environment is very topical in the modern world .
Amount of garbage is encreasing at the same time with encreasing amount of humans .
The growth of consumption in developing countries leads to encreasing consumption more energy , water and other sources .
Pollution of the ecosystems is groving to in these countries as a result .
This problems are topical in our city Kyiv to .
Nowadays our local governmet is making some desisions for improving the situation .
It is going to build several modern combustion plants , some programmes for discrete rubbish collection are implementnig .
There are a lot of citizens movement except oficial activities .
People orginise common action for cleaning nearhouse territories .
Some activists plant out trees in spring .
These activities especially have a place in spring and in outumn .
I hope that most of the big enterprises , plants and stations will be taken out of the city border .
this days the transportation become so crawdad .we have a lot of cars in the streets .
there are a lot of accidents because many people driving so fast .
we should put many cameras in the street to know how is caused of this accidents .
if every body know that there are a punishment for what they do and no body can escape from what he did I guess we will have a few of transportations accident .

Another reason why I like it is because it is a team sport so you can learn and evolve with them .

Nowadays , people are getting more independent , and more than this problem , society now needs to show the other this independence and control of their own lives , which includes cars , houses and materials .
On the one hand , travelling by car can be an excellent way to move yourself for where you want to go , without going on foot to find your bus station and becomes less important if you live in the centre of your town or in the suburbs .
Another advantage of travelling by car is that you do n't have to spend time waiting for your other transport , as also as you can avoid the confusion of people that are in the subway stations every morning to get in the line you want to arrive at work in time .
On the other hand , public transport are the only resource some people have to move on , and more than excellent to the environment , it 's also a good way to avoid traffic and spend money on petrol , once it 's cheaper if you catch a bus .
Another disadvantage is that using the car can be useless in some situation , like if you go to a football game by car , you probably wo n't have a place to park it .
In conclusion , cars wo n't let public transports be forgot , once more than providing the only way some people have to travel , cars are n't so convenient for some situations .
I think you must go to a large school in the town because here you can have more friends and you can do a lot of other things that you can do in the countryside .
I really want to go to a big school in the town because here in the countryside I can go out with my friends or go shopping with them .
I the town you can do everything fun .
You can go to the shopping , to the halfpipes , to the skateparks and you can do a lot of other cool things with your friends but in the countryside no .
But you must go to the school that you want , this is just my advice ok ?
I really want that you be happy with your new life .
A big kiss and a big hug
Anna
I think that the family and friends are the most important in our lives because if you have some problems they are always here and they try to help you .
These people can influence in our life for example , if you have a bad friends you become a bad person and you will have probles in your live.so , your education depends on the people around you .
It is not important if these people are friends or family , they can change our lives for better or worst , depend on you choose the best thing that it can help you .
As we know , in our days everything is possible .
We have so many advantages that make our lives easier .
Even the way of studying has changed .
In general , people have the possobility to study in libraries or using the computers .
Studying in libraries asks a lot of quiet and patience .
There you must n't speak lauder and you always have to wait for your turn to borrow something or you have to wait if another student has the book you need .
Personally , I think studying on a computer it 's a better chooise .
I 'm not saying that just because of the easy way by you can study what you want .
Studying using a computer offers you the possibility to be more relaxed when you do it .
In this way , you can maybe read aloud .
If I were a student that usually studies in a library I would definitely try to study on a computer .
In this way I would n't waste a lot of time .
If somebody says that there is no future for public transport i mind immediately . today there are too many vehicles in our streets .
the roads are chock a block.everybody has a private car .
people is thinking about comfortable life instead of environment and cost saving .
Hi , Shannon :
About my town in the future .
It will be very different .
Meanly , the change in the environment .
Also , every year , there are more companies that produce different types of pollution in our planet .
For this , I think that the climate will change in 20 years .
Therefore , the animals do not survive with this climate .
Also , the humans ca n't go to the Street all day , only a few hours for the hot climate .
The live there will be harmful for everybody !
We need to do something to sabe the world !
What do you think about this ?
Take care ,
Conchi .
The members of my Family are certain my real best friends , whose i can trust and ask everything without shameless or regrets .
I think they are our first friends and our first confidents .
All days they prove they are the persons whose care about me .
Thionk about family 's routine .
Every morning they take breakfast together , speaking about things not too important .
They listen to you , discuss our problems .
Sorry for taking too long to get back to you , it 's the end of the quarter and you know how crazy is this period for a sales man .
Yes , you can share my contacts .
I would like to understand the benefits of an MBA at IMD and how it would help me on my career .
Talking about the world cup a little .
Watching to our national teams games , I got the conclusion that we have no need to check our heart condition .
Brazil and Nederlands games were a real test for our health .
What do you think ?
I appreciate your support .
Kind Regards .
According to the reality a lot of young people are n't very communicated in their life .
They think their life is so boring and also very mad .
But I think different .
For example in your childhood you are much more happiest than your Parents because their job is not very easy .
They have to look after their children and it 's very stressed I think .
Most teenagers ca n't understand that , and they think that the job of their parents is not difficult .
Firstly , young people usually calm down trough the music for example classic music .
But most of young society are not interested this type of music .
for instance they prefer Pop or also rock music .
Through you listen the music you can expressed your emotions and this is the most beautiful thing .
Secondly , they like watching series in a TV .
That make their happy and additionally make loud .
Usually the watch criminal series because it 's very interesting and really mysterious .
Teenagers have different styles .
A lot of young mans love wearing jeans and t - shirt .
Because it 's very comfortable .
But girls love wearing skirt and snug shirt .
I think the style is very important in our life .
Across style we can express our emotions and feelings .
In conclusion life of young people is not very easy .
We have a lot of unhappy days and we have a lot of problems too .
hi my name is Adrian i am 17 years old and i am footballer . I was born too be a footballer .
We were playing everyday football in the school and I was the best .
I was even better than the older children everyone was telling me too go to a team .
but i dident had too do anything , a team took when i was 11 years old .
The name of the team was Katsa .
i was at this team for 5 years and the made me even better in football .
I played my first match at 16 years old and i felled very special because i was 16 and i was capable of putting 3 goals .
I played so good that everyone gave me congratulations but that s not all one of the best team of the world wanted too take me .
I was very happy and of course i agreed .
For my opinion , I 'm definitely agree with that .
Already , for only 20 years a lot of thing because of the technology .
And I think that iy 's not a technology will change but the people and their caracteres themselves .
Unfortunaly , for this generation there wo n't be a real relationship , all relation will become a virtual relationship .
The good news is the average of people who can take advantage of the technology can economise a lot of time because they might have a sophisticate robot can help at home .
According my experience , if we do n't exagerate the way we use technologie like internet , phone , satellite .
It will be the good thing that we can spend our time for a good thing
In some people 's lives the most important is to wear fashionable clothes .
On the one hand , I think it is important tolook good , but sometimes the latest fashion is not the best choiceto feel happy and comfortable .
For example , now the high - heeld shoes is very trendy but it costs a lot and the most woman does n't look good in it .
On the other hand , the personality is more important and determinative than an expensive dress , it is a fact .
Butif somebody wants to follow the latest fashion , I accept it , because she just in those clothes feels good .
In conclusion , my opinion is that the personality is more important than the clothes we wear , but everybody has his own life and a choice to decide what she wants .
Transportation is one of the most essential part of our day to day life ; whether it is puplic or private , transport takes the same priority in each one 's life from the very early days .
Basically , we 've land , water and air transport for reliable purpose .
In the age before the industrialisation came in to exsitance , people were also using various alternatives to travel from one place to another .
They mostly depend on animal to make cart to ride on them .
Then the technology improved gradually towards mechanical engines to make the transport more convinient .
The developed version of all those engines are use in the running vehicles of land , water and air which make our life more faster .
But in this modern era of globalisation , global warming is one of the prime concern of the earth .
And when we look at the modern technologies of transportation , it glances no future for public transport .
It is inevitably true that , excessive use of public transport leads to higher level of pollution .
So , it would better to go for any other alternative of green technology for future purpose to make this world a better place .
Yesterday , I had a wonderful day .In the morning I went to a Galician basketball training with a coach of Spanish selection , when finished went to my parents to a hotel to eat and stay with some friends , after the food meet with friend 's of my parents and went to a theme park and we rode to a rollers coaster , it was very exciting and we ate a chocolate ice cream , it was delicious .At night we went to a match of Spanish basketball league , Obradoiro versus Real Madrid and that match won the team of Real Madrid and then I went home to sleep .
This is my wonderful day .

My favorite band is " cbjr " , its a brazillian band , the type of music is rock and rap , yours music are very easy to single .

Generally speaking , it has been suggested that mixed - sex education will improve to the degree of learning system at schools .
In another way of saying , this kind of education system should be included in the whole classes in all schools .
However , I strongly believe that the measurement of education level does not explicitly interest with sex differences in the classes , but also it is related to the quality of education level in the schools .
Education has a crucial part in one society and it 's future and by improving the level of educations system , students can learn more effectively in their entire education life and their career but also their skills will be improved by this process .
Nowadays , unfortunately , students can not take enough education from their schools whereas in some poor countries .
Their systems are no longer that good enough and students will not make a good career for their future .
On the other hand , by building more effective learning system which will provided by local authority , students will encouraged them learn more efficient .
Lack of teaching way , poor audience of the class , quantity of learning materials , for instance , all of these matters should be enhanced until the good quality has been set up in the system .
Besides , by putting these kinds of procedures , students will also gain more respect towards career and their job .
Hopefully , they will reach not only earn more money in their entire life but also society will have more development shape in any other developed counties .
It is true that coeducation can motive the student while they work with other sex group students , we ought to also bear in mind , this is not only solution to get best result .
Therefore , we should consider other kinds of problems which affect on education system .
In a nutshell , based on the above - mentioned point such as , quality of educations system not only interests with mix - education but also it will need some good solutions in some subjects that mentioned .
It is personally concluded that this kinds of developments will be put into the action for all schools shortly .
I like my family and my friends .
For that , is a pleasure speak about them !
I am starting to introduce my favorite family members .
My sister is older than me two years .
She has an important person to me since my 8 years .
Our parents separated in 1980 , when I was 8 and when she was 10 .
Since this time , we stayed very linked until now .
We have a good relation , she is my main friend .
She knows all about me .
My father is other person important to me .
I appreciate his a lot , because he stayed with me and my sister and his life changed completely .
He invested in our education and today he has much admiration on our life and our decisions .
When I became , first teenager and after an adult , I knew the majority of my friends , a good friends .
We keep a regular contact , we go out to dinner or take a coffee many times .
More recently , I can not forgot my husband and my daughter .
Both are very important in my emotional stability .
In fact , I feel they are the most important people in my life !

Our world is very polluted by public transport so we think about what will happen in the future .Public transport causes many problems in our environment such as , difficult reaching to the nearest destination , the pollution , and causing diseases .
We must think alternative solutions for this problem .
We face difficulty in reaching in our own destination .
Many people who go to their work late .
Hence , if everyone has a private car he can go to his work on time .
Using the public transport makes us arrive late because it stops many times .
With our private car , we can do many tasks in our day , but using buses we waste our time , and more efforts .
Buses run with petrol that causes pollution .
Nowadays , there are some vehicles run with electricity.we can decrease pollution by using electricity .
Hence this will help people to be in a good health .
In addition , crowded buses cause affection among people .
private cars reduce the affection .
Crowded buses spread epidemic in our society .
Finally , we hope a healthy future for our new generations . We want to reach our destination on time and live in safe life without diseases and pollution .
my favourite sport is volleyball.i play it since 2006.my best position is number 2.i used to play it in faculty of engineering selection.it makes me fit and long .
i like it very much .
i used to play it with my frindes .
when i enter the egyptian armed forces , i played for the air defense forces team .
we won the 1st position , and got the cup of competition.if anyone attends to play this game , he should practice hard to be able to play it proffesionaly .
Further to the trade fair of the last week where we were a pleasure to meet you and we were talking about you courses .
I am looking for an organizational development course .
Could I have contact with any of your customer for more information ?
I am available to talk with you on Monday in the morning .
I am looking forward confirmation .
My favourite sport :
When I was a child , about four or five years old , my father teaches me what was football , and I loved it but , I really liked the goalkeepers , why I like football since childhood .
I think football shows you a lot of feelings and experiences .
I enjoy football because it is a form to forget problems and enjoy a bit , because when you are playing football , you are n't thinking other stuff , you only are concentrate at the game .
Football is a sport where anything can happen , no always win the best teams and is unpredictable , there is n't a dream team .
The football is a good form to do exercise because it is interesting and funny .
And if you do n't like do sport you can watch the matches of the teams around the world .
The most important invention is the mobile , because you can do whatever you want in only one communication device .
Today , it 's smaller , faster and cheaper than before .
Not only children have one , grandparents have either .
But with this gadget , we have a big problem : people are becoming isolated , we are living in our own world .
You can do a lot of things using your mobile , like : call someone , text , take pics , listen to music , watch movies , play games , wake you up ( alarm clock ) , access the internet , check your e - mails , pay your bills , access the social media , learn how to cook ... there are many more unthinkable things we can do .
But now , children want to have one as soon as possible , they do n't play hide and seek and play sports like before .
And one consequence of this is they have health problems .
Another problem is if your mobile is stolen , the thief can access all your personal life , he can check your e - mail , see your photos , etc .
And people are getting isolated , once I saw a mother using your mobile instead of taking care of her baby !
This is so sad !
In the future , it will probably we can almost everything using mobile , but we might pay attention in how this affects our life .
The pie charts illustrate the amount of household earnings allocation within regular families in two different years ( 2000 and 2010 )
overall , in both years , the amount of earnings allocation predominantly from Housing then followed by food / clothes .
There were a significant rise in the number of budget allocation from both categories ( Housing and food / clothes ) in 2000 and 2010 .
In contrast , Vacation / leisure and Misc were decrease over the same period of time .
Regarding the pie charts , there were significantly increased in the number of earnings allocation for Housing and Food / Clothes from about 35% and 25% in 2000 to about 50% and 35% in 2010 respectively .
However , the allocation of household budget for Misc , which was the least among other categories in 2010 ( around 15% ) , fell by 10% in 2010 from around 15% to approximately 5% respectively .
Furthermore , there was a slight decrease in Vacations / leisure allocation from 25% in 2000 to around 10% in 2010
Actually , the public transport show really no future .
The governments did n't had been giving good ideas to improve the public transport .
There are two good reasons for doing not use public transport in the future .
Firstly , the no continue the construction of more rail line of train to public transport is a one reason .
Secondly , people do n't like the old buses in the city centre .
Consequently , people prefer move in your own car .
On the other hand , I think there are two aspects that can change the actual situation .
The first is , The government can create a new plan os construction of trains .
The second aspect is , people can help to pay more tax to buy new buses .
As a result , we can have a public transport more comfortable .
In my opinion , the public transport can have future if all we collaborate us to improve .
Unless we do so , I believe no future for the public transport .
There are widely differing views on the issue of whether or not the benefits of study foreign language in earlier age outweigh the drawbacks .
Some people would suggest that learning new language before second school discourage their usual learning and that would struggle their understanding of other subjects .
However , I personally believe that the advantages is overweight .
The reasons for this as follows .
Learn how to walk before learn how to run , the opponents contend the children confuse the words and phrases with their mother tongue .
Confronting with challenges , primary students are struggled on the difference between first language and the learning one .
Thus , people view that children learn foreign language at primary school are worse than later .
Nonetheless , I would contend that learning foreign at primary school brings countless benefits to children .
Primary school , the best moment for learning , children are easier and faster to gain knowledge .
Not only less study burden when compare by secondary school , but they are able communicating with foreigners as well as extend their societal network during that period and the later life .
Rather than concern about the challenges , children would confront with , it is particularly advantaged for them to grasp foreign language during the elementary school .
By way of conclusion , I once again reaffirm my position that advantages of learning foreign language at primary school is much outweigh than the drawbacks .
Given that these children would have a better development in the future as well as more free time .
it is a story of a boy , who always find out the way to tease her sister sukh .
one day he got fight with her sister , even he made her cry.both of them stop talking to each other and after some day the boy need laptop of her sister sukh .
sukh was so angry with him because he heart her a lot , sukh refuse to give her laptop and her brother start again fighting with her and even he slapped her sister .
sukh start crying and she said she is not going to give you my laptop until you do n't feel sorry .
her brother pick her laptop and threw it and broke her laptop , then boy closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
In my opinion people 's lives will change dramatically in 50 years or so , because the world is changing all the time , and we have a lot of technology and things to do .
People change their way of thinking and try to do new things .
What is more , they do not the same things as their parents did .
To sum p I thonk it is enevitable .
The door of the room is closed .
Number 's room was 666 .
He knew that she was inside , waiting for the last conversation in relation with the life of Rose .
He pushed the door and come in .
She was sitting on the chair .
When she saw him , she smiled .
Then she started talking : " Welcome pretty boy , I am waiting for you , please sit down " .
He took a chair , staring her with rage . "
As you well know , rose 's life is your hands " she said and keep talking:" ... You are the only one , that can save her life , but before you must comply with your promise"."I Know it " he replied with a sad tone .
Then she took the document and stared reading in aloud voice : " With this agreement your soul is mine " .
Micheal did not know what think .
He loved rose with his entire soul , a soul that is losting .
Suddely , he took the agreement and signed with his blood the paper .
I do not care he thought , maybe I lost my soul but now she is alive .
After that , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
on the last vacation I went to France , to Paris with my colleague Sebastian for 2 weeks .
On the first day in France , we bought a French croissant for breakfast .
Then we went to the stadium Parc des Princes where we could not reach ,
and due to lack of knowledge of the language , nobody wo nt tell us which way to walk to the stadium .
By accident we ran into a good fairy who , with the young learned to all language in the world and thus led our stadium .
We made friends with this fairy after one entire day walking with her feel like you we knew each other a lifetime .
After the first week in France found that in Paris there is a large crowd .
For this reason , we left with a new friend to Marseilles , where there was less traffic .
We chose this city because of no input into the sea and it was filmed taxi in which he played a famous actor .
After spending two weeks with a fairy in France , we had to go back to school and fairy to do .
End .

Last year I was in London with my friends , Elena , Amélie and Ariana .
At first we went to our hotel .
It is near to the Hyde Park .
We went to the Hyde Park and sat down on a bank .
A hour later we went to the London Eye .
It is really very very big .
In the London Eye we can look all over London .
It is a very big city .
Then we go to the Big Ben .
The clock is very big and we stood there a long time .
Then we go to a red bus and drove to our hotel .
London is a very exciting city .
Speaking about reading .
Reading is one of the most important habits .
Reading opens new horizons , made you imagine .
One of the most favorite books for me is , the power of your subconscious mind .
this book tells you how to use the power of your mind , and how to make yourself happier .
I wish I could spread the idea of reading among young people .
Reading is a must for having a great nation .
letter written to report , about awful environment situation in my city !
Kiev , Ukraine .
we already did a lot , but still to do more needed .
first of all , rubbish factories should be sent behind the city
people who litter on the streets its one of the biggest problems .
So my proposition is to post some informative letters and posters around the city , and give bigger punishment for littering!Also from the government side to increase of trash bins and facility staff members .
clients search , customers support , conflicts solutions
compilation of wedding arrangements and bouquets
People used to use public transport a lot .
Public transport is very inconvenient .
Gas prices have come down a lot .
People can afford cars easily .
Some people live very far from the bus stop .
They have to walk a long distance to get to the bus stop .
Buses are very crowded .
Buses take a very long route .
It takes you very long time to get to your destination .
If you have a car you can get to your destination in a short time .
Our town takes care of the enviremont of our neighbourhood very seriously .
There are many places where you can throw away your rubbish .
On these sites there are different kinds of containers for all sorts of rubbish which you can collect at home .
Like glass , plastic or paper -containers .
The centre of our town , where the supermarket is , does also have a site for dumping your rubbish .
In the supermarket you can find a container for batteries .
Not only the supermartket has these containers , they are also in the schools of the neighbourhood .
In my opinion this gives a good example of the involness of the local government .
Another point where I 'm pleased about is that our town is kept clean by a special group of employees of our community .
This happens weekly .
They walk around in all the streets and pick up all the dumped material .
This makes our neighbourhood a pleasant place to be .
For the last I can say that they not also put containers for all your rubbish , but even special containers in the parks for the the dogs their ' pooh ' .
So this helps that the children could play in a much cleaner park .
Studying overseas is not only changing condition , but also facing many sorts of unknown pressure .
Roughly speaking , there are three causes of pressure .
First of all , the biggest problem is studying .
It is not easy to adapt a new learning environment , the language is the biggest difficulty .
Students have to do assignments with another language and use different thinking manner .
The second problem could be from peers ' stresses .
The culture shock is that international students need to overcome .
Students want to make new local friends , but cultural customs and taboos could be a problem to be noticed and adapt .
Lastly , the problem is from students themselves .
Leaving comfort zone , and everything is fresh .
Students have to confront and get over every challenge .
As family and friends do not accompany , students must do a lot from basic living to future studies .
It is hard to live overseas alone , Therefore , making friends from the same country can assist one another .
Besides , attempting open mind .
To get along with international friends is a great way to expand horizon .

Subject : Shopping facilities
Report on the shopping facilities in Katowice
Introduction
The aim of this report is to describe and assess shops , which could be interesting for tourists .
The majority of people visiting Katowice are focused on three matters : sovenirs , fashion and food .
Souvenirs
It seems that there is not many places in city center where you can find souvenirs like postcards or books about the history of Katowice .
Fortunately , visitors would find all of that in the Tourist Information Ofiice and in shops on the outskirts .
The one , which is really worthy to see is " Kato - Sovenirs " .
They provide all sorts of funny local gadgets .
Fashion
My favorite sport is football .
It 's the most popular sport all over the world .
I enjoy it because it 's well known and easy to find partners to play with .
Watching football is also a wonderful experience .
My favorite international league is the English premiere league .
My advice to anyone who will start this sport is to start it early and play it regularly not to loose fitness .
Also joining a team will be a great idea .
The environment is an important part of our life contributing in a positive way in our part of life without even concern about important parts for us to survive .
Humans can easily damage the environment just throw their waste without recycling or ruin the places where animals are living .
Deforest the woods can damage the cycle of nature .
Without forest ca n't be animals and the human being can disappear .
Some people do n't even care and just the do n't to earn money deforests the trees and sell to do furniture .
They even are not plant other trees .
I notice that in supermarkets are using so much plastic just to cover a small thing or are using many plastic bags without even think how vulnerable is for the environment .
I used to live for a short time in a place where word recycle was completely ignored but they used to this because that was n't so rich .
Where I live now I noticed that have the opportunity to recycling the waste because it is a posh area .
In my opinion I think the government should take care of all area , even is a poor or rich area .
The pollution has a negative contribution to the environment .I saw on television that wild birds are healthier in rural area than birds from urban area .
Birds from urban area is difficult for them to find a proper food instead .
Some people from area which I live they used to feed the birds but others they do n't even care .
To keep all the nature alive we must contribute everyone of us for future generation .
Travelling by car is more comfortable than public transport , easier and faster .
you can go by your car and at any time , but you ca n't by public transport .
you must not wait for your car but you must wait the public transport .
you do not pay any fees to travel by your car .

To conclude I want to say that I 'm the godfather of his eldest son .
My wife is a very special person to me , I like her very mush .

Hi , my name is John Keats and I 'm aged 21 .
I am writing to apply for your job offer .
I have already worked in summer camps in France and in Italy for children aged 7 - 13 . I am cheerful , energetic and hardworking .
I usually work in the kitchens so it does not bother me .
Moreover , I am willing to help organize sports or evening activities .
Moreover , I do like looking after children .
For instance , I take care of my nephews once a month because nowadays my brother is often busy .
I can go all over the USA without any problems and I can help the staff to get around if needed since I have the driving license .
Therefore I think that I am the suitable person for the job .
yesterday night , i went to a restaurant with my family ..
l love the place , nice decoration of restaurant .
the waiter come to us and took the order .
my family ordered the dinner but l ordered specially pizza and coke because l love pizza .
we ate the food and enjoyed a lot .
l love that day spent with my family ..
l wish l have come at weekends with my family and friends .
This report is about how my city takes care of the environment .
The evolution of my city is more or less similar to the evolution of my country .
I am living in the center of Spain , in a small city .
When I was child , my city was dirty because people were throwing their rubbish on the floor .
However , a few years ago the government has paid more attention to the environment to our country ; for example they made a lot of advertisement on televion , in newspapers and on the internet to explain that the rubbish is not good for our world .
Nowadays , we can see in all street a lot of bins and it is difficult to see rubbish on the floor because many people are cleaning the city .
Also , children must clean their school once a month .
These types of actions produce good habits in our society .
In the future , we must do an effort to improve our environment because we will want to give the same world or if it is possible a better world than before to our sons .
No body can deny that transportation is one of the most important things in our life .
No country can live without transportation as it 's the real meaning of connection between each other .
Cars are much convenient but this not mean that all other means of transportation are not important .
sometimes many people want to travel faraway along distances so they need planes .
other people prefer to travel by trains as it 's faster and more comfortable than cars .
Many countries like to travel by bikes in order to decrease the pollution which happened by car exhausted.to my point of view i prefer travelling by cars which is more comfortable .
Now in every country we have lot of transportation means as planes , trains , undergrounds , cars , ships , and rockets .
public transportation is the mean reason to delivery people everywhere in a small time . in the past the had to use camels to travel which waste lot of time and tiredness .
Today our life is running by clock .
We need a vehicle to reach our work place .
If we use our public transport services .
we may be late to office / working place .
So we must use the personal vehicle .
Everybody thinking like the public transport is not comfort for us , but environmentally the public transport is suitable to decrease the pollution and our energy sources also decrease .
In Lublin is a beautiful castle .
It is my favourite place in Lublin .
It is located next to the Old Town .
It was built in twelfth century .
The castle 's look is in the Neo - Gothic style .
At the castle is Holy Trinty Chapel .
It is in a Gothic style .
It was built as a foundation of King Casimir the Great .
This is one of the most valuable monuments in Poland .
There is a tower by the castle in the Roman style .
This tower is a precious monument of roman art and it is one of the oldest building in the Lublin .
It was a part of the borough castellan .
Castle also has a courtyard .
Now on the castle is a museum .
It to belong to the oldest and the biggest museums in eastern Poland .
This museum has a monuments of the superiority .
In my opinion it 's the one of the most fascinating place in Poland and the most wonderful site in Lublin . I think that everyone should visit this castle .
The restaurant that I will talk is Woody Pool .
Woody Pool is in Spain .
This restaurant has a good atmosphere because it is always people laughing and talking about funny things .
The food in this restaurant is very good and has a subnormal size because it is much bigger than the useful food .
The famous dishe of this restaurant is a huge hamburgure
This restaurant will be an amazing place to the call meet there because like I said before the atmosphere and food are amazing .
In my opinion , public transport will become more and more important in the future . Travelling by car maybe is convenient , but it also brings air pollution and traffic jams .
If in a city there were only cars , the city would n't afford enough parking lots and roads , all the cars would jam the city , and people would n't get their destinations .
On the other hand , cars need more gasoline than buses which let out CO2 and other kinds of waste gases into the air , leading to the serious air pollution .
So , what we need is to devote much more money and time to improve the public transport .
Public transport will have bright future ; on the contrary , travelling by car will vanish from our life .
My favorite way is Train .
Plane is most fastest in another way to travel .
However , plane is most dangerous way to travel .
Boat is the most cheapest in another way to travel .
However , boat is most slowest way to travel .
So , train is intermidiate way to tarvel .
My favourite sport is boxing .
Because I like boxing .
I like fight , because I like to hit someone .
I start this sport when I was 11 years old , my dad let me go to box and I start that sport .
Then I started to go with my friends .
I started leading trener in the competition and I love this sport .
My favourite boxer is Floyd Mayweather .
He is very good on this sport .
Today , the people use more cars , which leads to more cars on the street , traffic and pollution .
I think is better the idea that the people to use public transportation instead of using private cars or motorcycles
Firstly , people do not have to buy their own cars .
Accordingly , people do not have to spend lots of money on gas that they have to fill the tank .
Also , they do not have to find a place for parking as well .
Therefore , these are the reasons why I agree with the form to lower the congestion and air pollution by encourage people to use less private cars and turn to use more public transportation and other forms for transportation
It was a cold day at night when I was at home watching my favourite programme on my telly called " dare to win " , I was with my brother , when we decided to call , The programme is about questions for the contestants that must be answer in correct time , and there is a different things for the winner .
A few minutes later we were listening ourselves in the programme , we were so nervous but it was exciting for us , our goal in the programme was get a free ticket for the most popular electronic party in the world .
Despite our nervous we did it well ! and our dream come true , yeah , we 'll be glowing in the dark !
Funding for the English Language Club
As the secretary of the English Language club I am writing you this proposal to persuade you as to why it would benefit both the students , and the college if we would receive funding from you .
Dear sir or madam ,
I am writing to aplaay for the job in the USA , published in an advertisement , last Monday .
I had recently finished my course of english in Cambridge , also I have a fresh and improve English .
In order to help organising on sports and evening activities , I am a young person of 12 years old .
Many people say that there is no future for public transport as cars are now so much cheaper and easier to buy .
Additionally , because public transport is expensive and does not have a comprehensive coverage of most cities private cars are more attractive for most poeple .
Dear Bob .
I went to our new shopping centre last week at the downtown .
Actually I am very happy to tell you that we have a lot of new stores , including apple 's store .
Long ago we had no stores to buy products or whatever were our needs .
However from now one we can buying what we really need , on the other hand this shopping may help a lot of people get back working again .
A few weeks ago I went into apple 's store , so that I bought a new mobile phone , it is awesome because it has reliable tools which allows me doing my daily working .
Some people say that a tripp by car is more convenient that by the public transportation , but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations .
It is true that travel to a nearby place from your city , it is more comfortable getting there by car , and the ease of have your car to get wherever you want without spending money and time paying cabs .
But , the public transportation have a lot of future bacase a lot of reassons , first the time , if the place you want to reach finally is really far the different type of vehicles of public transportation will get you there faster than your car , also the complications about the field , like if you want to go from America to Europe there is no highway that cross the ocean you need an airplane and unless you have one , you will can not reach travel between continents with your car , a different reasson is politics , because if you want to go from anywhere in the USA to Alaska you will not need to pass through Canada , the commodity is a really important reasson because drive for 8 hours is exhausting and it will be unsafe also , the economics is a factor to , because the attrition of your car it will be more that in the normal use and the price of food and extra stops that you will need to do , it will be expensive that in public transportation .
In conclusion , for me it is a lie that the public transportation has no future , however , they have to make improvements to this like the use of better ways of fuel or energy , one way is using renovable sources of energy such as solar , haeolic ( wind ) or hidraulic(water),Also there are biodisel , and gasoline extracted from seaweed .
And the public transportation will be more important in a few years than now .
Dear Anne . Thank for your letter asking about my fmily and my Friends .
Saying that , my family is the best and they love me much .
I have a father , a mother and a brother .
My brother lives in Barcelona with him girlfriend and he is very happy with her .
I live with my parents in Lagartera and I am very happy as they help me .
Also , I have very Friends .
They are wonderful because they are always when I need them .
Nowadays , It is possible to find any kind of Tvs programmes you want and yes , I consider that there is very much sport on television , but , not too much .
The way of life of people has began more and more stressful .
When somedoby to get at home he wants only relax in front of Television .
Besides this , Tvs companies have understood sports provides this relaxess moment , mainly for men .
Then It put on Televison more and more sports programmes .
In this view , I consider , though , there is lots of sports on Televison , they are not too much , because the people have looke for it .
In conclusion , I think that Tvs companies only want to sell their product and the people want to have their relax moment with the sports programmes .
Last summer , we went to Córdoba to attend a very important dance competition ...
We left from our city on Monday , and we arrived Carlos Paz on Thursday .
We stayed in one of the most beautiful hotels in that place , with a nice view and with nice people around .
When the day came , we performed an amazing coreography and we went back home with 3 gold medals .
We really enjoyed this experience , just because we shared it as friends and we took dance lessons with the most professional and privileged dance teachers of the world .
The album American Beauty/ American psycho is the sixth album released this year by the well - known American rock band Fall out boy that has a huge followers in several countries .
The album with eleven tracks that reach top one , won a gold and silver certifications for the best - selling in diverse countries as the USA , Canada and the UK .
This American band is known for their lyrics that hold something different from other the bands something close to a emocional statement .
Even in this albums that the band abandon their own root and add a bite of the pop genre in it .
I really recommend this album because of the lyrics and the sound because it catch you , almost like a great poetry .
I agree with the statement that people 's live will change dramatically in the next years , for previsible reasons that I will explain in following text .
Firstly , the biggest reason that people 's live will extremely change in the future is because of technology .
Technology is increasing in all the world .
New technology has improve systems in many areas society , mainly in Information Systems .
The Information trhough of the Internet , had beem each day more quickly and it is reaching all parts of the world .
Furthermore the things and process is in evolution .
Life of people is turning easiest and comfortable .
On industries , the big machines is making new products for our welfare .
Although , the advancement of technology , besides than bring advantages for everyone , it 's also will cause disadvantages , such as unemployment because machines will make the same or work better than humans .
that 's why I agree that people 's live will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
USA Summer Camp , I am interested in he vacancy of the summer camp .
I 'm cheerfully , diligently and organized person .
And also I love children .
I am accustomed to work with children because the last two summers I worked in summer camps and I have two little sisters that I love them and which I spent a lot of hours take care of them .
I am a hardworking and a committed person in all aspects .
They are the reason why I 'm great for these job .
Also the last summers helped me to be preparing on more things that the children demand children .
For an example I learned about the organization , how control big groups of children , and entertaining activities for children .
I hope you get interested In my application .
I will be waiting for your answer and thank you for the time .
Nowadays , cost to buy a car that can take the whole family is not expensive anymore .
Car is not an expensive thing to have anymore .
As we know , the privilege having a travel by car is more convenient than by public transport .
We could stop in everywhere we want to stop .
We could visit every places with no limitation time .
If there was someone who asked me " What is your favorite sport ? and why are you enjoy it ? " I would tell that my favorite sport is soccer and it could let me know how important the team work is and I could always feel that there was a kind of power , like someone putting me into the water from the high place , to push me running and kicking the ball .
I had to say that feeling was really awesome .
It made me feel like that happiness is running through out my body .
I will suggest people who want to starting this sport , first you must find five to six friends to make a team , and then look for other friends to make another team , so that you can fight with other to get the score .
second , all you have to do is warm your body , if you do n't warm it before the race you might hurt yourself .
Third all you can do is play for fun with your friends .
what is it the best ?
Public transport , our cars or natural transport as a bike .
My techer said that public transport has not future in our society , because travelling by car si so much more adecuate , never the less I am disagree with her opinion because if we use public tranposrt we will pollute less .
No one can deny the importance of travelling .
Without travelling people would be very bored , life would be very monotunes .
So , in the future we will dispense of types of transportation .
In these days , we use cars to travel between countries .
Cars are very easy to use .
People ca n't dispense of cars these days .
Families ca n't dispense of cars .
So we should know the right way to drive .
We should be careful when we drive .
We should be careful from careless drivers .

Last week my class and another one went to a school tripin Sicily .
We visited many cities like Taormina , Siracusa , Agrigento , Marsala and Trapani , and we saw a lot of monuments of Greek history .
We stayed in three different hotels and one day , we went also to the sea in Giardini Naxos .
The best thing I saw was the Valley of the temples , because there were a lot of ancient temples and monuments and ruines and they were really beautifuland also the panorama was amazing !
That day , there was a great time and it was sunny and hot ; I took a lot of photos and I learned new particulars about these important buildings .

To be honest I do n't believe in Ufo .
on the world recorded a lot of cases where the ufo was seen .
ufo story started already in antiquity .
on the walls of caves are sketches and paintings which show strange creatures and flying sauceres .
universe is colossaling and still we are knowing little about it .
maybe we do n't be alone and ufo exist ?
in addition more and more scientists agree with alien really exist
I am person that like going to do exercise , for this reason I like practise some sports , but the truth is that my favorite sport all around the world is the soccer .
I believe that play soccer is an excellent activity , because in every game that the people can like always has to exist some rules .
This kind of rules are very important , in my opinion , because when you do an activity and comply with the rules you are being a better person .

Our Future 's Lives :
The past already happened , we can not change it .
The future we do not know what 's coming .
But the present we live it , we live the moment and benefit from it at the maximum .
If you ask someone about the future , answers will be different but all will be around two main topics , Those last are either optimist future or pessimist one .
As far as I am concerned .
I do believe that people 's lives in the future will change toward the bad .
No because I am pessimist but due to several factors and condition allow me to divulgue my opinion .
Firstly , we are living in unstable world .
It is true that every day we have new innovation which help people and make their life more easier .
But from life 's experiences we can learn that the hidden target of human is not to help each other to lessen the burden of life .
Human are looking for a power and they are applying forest law , The stongest beat the weakest .
To illustrate .
There are a categorisation of countries , there are developed countries , emerged one and on the way of development countries .
Who classified those countries like this ?
whare the critria of this ranking ? and ...
These questions and a lot of queries of many people looking for convenient answer .
Hence , The above indicates details support the idea that there will be a change in people 's lives but in negative side .
In addition , A general vision on the human innovation show that the majority of people creations have bad effect , this effect exist even in people 's lives or themselves .
And unfortunately this bad impact exist almost in all lives filed .
For example .
Chemical drugs can help peolple to heal and improve from diseases but have another hidden effect .
This effect always leaves people suffering later after the usage .
Therefore , The afformentioned information above show that our future can be worse than our present .
To summarize , People 's life knows a fast change and development , but generally this evolution affecting people .
Should live in stabele and peaceful world .
We must stop all wars , conflict and impose human beings principls and values .
The restaurant I 'm going to review is called Tintos y Rubias and is located in downtown Montevideo .
It is specialized in barbecue , beers and wines .
The infrastructure of the place is quite wide and in the front side you can see a huge welcome sign .
The restaurant has a rustic design and it has outdoor tables .
The service provided by the restaurant is exceptional for example , the waiting time is very short .
And it is very well ordered .
In terms of food quality the level is extraordinary , they are well known for their roast meat .
There will be a future for public transport .
Petrol will run out in a few years .
We can produce electricity by creating wind wheels and water wheels .
Trains are going to be used evermore .
Public transport is going to be used more than ever .
There wo n't be enough space on the roads for cars one day .
There is a hotly debated issue of that whether student should take at least one year to work or travel before they go to university .
And the topic of people 's view can be approached from different angles due to its complexity .
Some people prefer this " gap year " theory while others seem to prefer disagree .
After careful considering this issue , I also develop my own points of view .
I favor the former statement , that is , I think student should have a gap year before they go to university , based on n1 , n2 .
Dear teacher ,
I agree with you about the future for public transport .
I am sure that there is a good future for it .
Every day , the combustible that we get to our cars is more expensive than use the public transport .
Nowadays , people use their cars to move for work , for holidays ...... but if the petroleo were cheaper , they could travelled very much .
It could be a good idea if the taxes were cheaper than the taxes of other things such a tobacco , alcohol ....
Thus , people could spend their free time travelling and having a good time .
what do you think about that ?
although traveling by car is really interesting but still using public transport has its advantages , by using public transport you 're saving effort when driving a car for along distance you will get tired , some people do n't have enough money to buy their own car .
I saw you uploading the cat into the glass bottle in Facebook .
I want to give you a few words .
Maybe you just think it 's fun but it 's been a good cause for your cat because of you 're joking .
If you want to raise animals , you must take care of it , love it and treat it like a family .
Although it is not human , they also have feelings .
You raise it once , it would regard you as the owner .
You are only relying on it .
I hope you will decide to cats do not let it hurt in future .
Furthermore , you abuse cat has violated not only the ethics but also the law .
I hope you can take down photos of being abused the cat and you can really reflect . Do n't repeat the same mistakes .
To keep the cat is not a simple matter which need to real love and good care .
So you decided to keep the cat must be the best , you can spend more time with the cat .
At any time to pay attention to the cat has not been sick .
The holiday you can go for a walk with a cat .
It is not difficult to do the thing .
As long as you are determined , you will be able to become a good master .
The diagrams below show the five stages aboout the process of making bank notes .

The most important step is Inspection : printed sheets manually inspected .
if you apply job like this must be the person who already been applied this job USA SUMMER CAMPS

There is no future for public transport , that is true , but I think that people are very comfortable and do n't think about the environment .
On the other hand , the public transport is the cheapest way to travel , although people do n't think of that aspect .
Secondly , you can drive your car everywhere , It does n't matter what time it is or where you would like to go . Travelling by car is much more convenient and comfortable than travelling by bus , by subway or by train .
In your car you can put inside all bags that you want to take .
These aspects or advantages are that I can say about this topic .

cell phone
I chose this invention that I think that helped to humanity to communicate more easily ,
Motorola It was the first doing something to a mobile phone was on 3 April 1973 the first to do so was an employee of Martin Cooper
Cooper made mobile phone history in April 1973 when he made the first ever call on a handheld mobile phone
After that , with the new technology they could invent new and better dispositives for the needs of users

My wife and I went to Ushuaia for four days but at the second day we realised that my wife had forgotten her glasses so we decided to come back .
When we arrived there were a lot of Matias'friends in our house listening loudly music , playing games and drinking .
We told them that had to leave our house immediately .
When everyone was out , we told of Matias because he organised a party without our permission .
He told us that he was really embarrassed about what had happened and he apologysed for her attitude
In my opinion , in future people do n't be used public transport .
It will be not tredy because everybody will have his own car .
These cars will be used alternative energy , for example energy of the Sun .
The modern science try to find new , more economic sources by energy .
do you have best friend in your life ?
what the meaning of friend ?
friend is people who will be there in your hard time and happy time , and friend is always encourage you all things you choose in your life .

Secondly , the student have a good body shape can easily to make new friends , and joining a sports team allows students to maintain good body shape .
For instances , the students joining the sports team needs to do some basic physical training to maintain their body shape .
According , the boy or girl have strong muscles can let them look more attractive .
Therefore , the student joining a sport team can maintain good body shape and it will let student become easier to make new friends .
Peter looked at his watch and knew he had to do something immediately .
It is said that when you survive to a situation which has made you be at the limit , you change .
And you can never return to be the one you used to be .
You are no more the person that people have expected .
But you do n't care about it .
Every hard situation may be got over easily when you make a big effort .
Peter has been thinking about this secret party for months since the time he knew his mother was healed .
He was taking care of her so that he was prevented from going to university .
He had to refuse to all his dreams suddenly .
However , the destiny has given him another chance to follow them .
Despite his strange behaviour , Peter 's mum did n't expect it at all .
She felt blessed as she was given such a perfect son .
It is said to happen once in life .
Peter has been kissed by her mum before , but this time was quite different .
Maybe he did n't notice it at all , but it was a farewell .
Now Peter could fly on his own .
Environment is the combination of air , earth , water forest and all these are interlinked with each other .
Most importantly , all species of animals and human being are the part of this ecosystem .
Human is the most wise and intelligent from all of these .
However , he is mainly responsible for disturbing this ecosystem with various activities .
Lets talk about one of them , that is ' cleanliness ' Nowadays , we all know that we are spreading the garbage near our houses and offices .
This may be due to people are not aware about consequences of this bad habit- spreading the rubbish .
But , in these days , with education , people are becoming more sensible and responsible towards the environment .
In the same line , dwellers of my village are doing lots of work to make their area clean and hygiene .
They collect house hold waste in a dustbin and put off with proper standard procedure .
They collect and segregate the rubbish in separate containers .
For example , they collect plastic waste in yellow dustbin while , liquid and solid , degradable waste in red container .
This makes easy and convenient to identify the waste types .
To conclude , I would like to say that nowadays people are becoming more aware and conscious towards environment through education .
Today in my class there was a discussion on television education .
Television is an object that help people to know the news in real time .
There are advantages and disadvantages ; television can also cause an dipendence , cartoons and " stupid " program can damage mostly young people .
Today there are many children that have the dipendence on television , they prefer to stay at home to watch the various child tv programs , while once our parents preferred hang out with your friends .
Television can be a useful strument if it is used with caution , accordingly I recommend use less it for prevent damage to the mental level .
I am concerned about pollution .
This issue has became a big problem to solve .
In order to help reduce contamination I take acction from the three " R".reduce , reuse and recycle as so I am more and more ecofriendly .
I reduce use of innecesary power at home , in other words , I turn on light that I need for the while i use it;I take less warm shower ; I hit only neccesary rooms .
In order to reuse , I convert all thing reusable , for example , plastic bottle as a plant pot ; glass bottle as a food container;I bring my reusable shopping bag and refuse to use a shopping plastic if a salemen offer me to bring .
Recycling is another way to be ecologist .
Today , we have more item to recycle as long as we clean properly and put in a proper bin , which will be use it by specialized factory in another item .
As long as i try to keep doing thing on a ecofriendly way i realize that i am give a little from my side and i feel careful of my environment .
Hello!!How are you ! !

PD : we have to meet
Hï Jo ,
In my opinion , it is a good idea about you spend some time travelling because you will have an opportunity to think about your future but in my city because of the crisis there is very little work for everyone .
Here , there are monuments , churches or famous people and perhaps to you in the future you would like to become a history teacher .
Although now that the holidays are coming you need people to help and ride the amusement park or the lights of the fair .
If you come to Linares could amuse you and if you come forward to work can do it
You have to come here because Holy Week in Linares is nice and the show is spectacular and if you want to have fun and I like the bulls
I hope to see you soon
Sonia
Hi Sara ,
It was great to hear from you .
It 's a very difficult decision for me too .
But if you want to decide , I 'll intend to help you .
On the one hand , you need a sport to keep fit .
On the other hand , music is the best for relaxing and enjoy .
Well , I think you should n't give up either .
You can devote more time to do both .
If I were you , I would go running at the morning and I would go to music classes after lunch .
So , you can do both .
I hope this help you and you will take the best decision .
Lots of love
Fira
I agree this affirmation because the public transport is more expensive than car , is slow and is less economic .
the car is less expensive , more confortable , more fast and more security .
every time the car is more utilized and more economic .
in my opinion the car more advantageous than car and the car is more useful
To my mind this mind not right .
First of all travelling by car is very expensive .
For example travelling by train is cheaper and travelling by plain is faser .
Secondly it 's not comfortable.becouse you every day drives instead of relaxing and enjoy the enviroment
Using public transport has certain advantages and also , disadvantages .
It is said that people prefer going by bus to a close place , but some of then do n't think the same .
The public transport has plenty of advantages .
Some people ca n't afford to buy a car or to pay for oil , as it is constantly rising , so using a public transport is an economic way to travel .
On the other hand it helps to reduce the polution made by cars , ..
Besides , it will be always useful for people ca n't drive .
Many people admit that if they could buy a car , they would do it .
The reason is they are tired of using public transport and they would get earlier to everywhere .
In the future , cars would be so cheap than everyone will have one , thus , it will take up the end of the public transport .
To sum up , I would say that people will use more and more public transport , as the oil is getting expensive .
The picture illustrate the progrocess of making notes .
There includes some most important steps .
Design is the first and the most important process .
It is the first step that costs troublesome , some things must be included the considerations , such as background colour , artwork , security issues .
Then , preparation of mental plates and skilled machinists are the needments .
Printing is the next step , .Usually , sheets of bank notes printed , because there are some special require for the printing , solour of both sides , special ink , images slightly raised .
The last step is the inspertion , sheete manually inspected .
The inspection always have three results , the good quality sheets , the bad sheet or the partially damaged sheets .
If the print sheets has good quality , they will packing and distribution.some partially damaged will cut into separate or packede or dispatched .The bad sheets will disposal , the destroyed will be secure .
My favorite sport is swimming .
I goes swimming since 1998 , when I had ten years old .
I like swimming because I feel a good sensation and my health is good .
Actually I not practice because I am not time , But a feel miss !
Now I go to the gym and practice weight lifting three Times A week , Exercises aerobics every days and yoga two times a week !
I every feel very well after come back the gym .
Often I go to the gym with my friend , Vanessa ,
But when she ca n't go I go Alone .
I always go !
My cough is very friendly and help me
The television is one of the most important AV media in the world .
You can use it for many purposes , according to your needs .There are a lot of channels in many roles , for instance , education , movies , songs , sports , news and so on .The television is not only for entertainment but also for education .The television can entertain you through it 's entertained channels , and the television can educate you through it 's educational channels .
At this time and age , most of the people have their own car or vehicle for their transportation .
It is also make convenient for people who are rushing time to work , meeting and so on .
However , I have no agree with this statement because the public transport is needed for someone who are no have vehicle or economic downturn .
Public transport is cheap and friendly for environment .
firstly , the fare of public transport is cheaper compared with buying a new car .
The person that do not have to save large amount of money to buy the car .
They can use the money in more useful or meaningful way such as investment property .
The fare of public transport is less than own vehicle when compared fare of bus to fulfill whole tank of oil .
Some more they are needed to pay a parking fee for parking .
Secondly , air pollution is a serious problem nowadays .
Because of everybody has to leave for another place through their own car and carbon dioxide released from the car .
The public transport is a way to reduce the air pollution because it can carry more than a dozen times the people in a time and reduce their own vehicle .
So , it can also help to reduce the traffic jam problem .
Lastly , public transport that are always blamed by the people that are slowly and trouble than own vehicle .
Although the public transport is slow but it also do not take a long time of people to reach their destination because public transport nowadays are developed more fast and enough .
In conclusion , public transport is needed for everybody in a necessary time .
It always can make us save the money and make the environment more nature and fresh .
Nowadays , the space for countries enlarges , instead of which , the area for farmland , forests and wetland is getting smaller .
This kind of situation brings all kinds of problems to mankind and animals .
The large - scale building projects took the space which should belong to the animals .
The food for them and their living space might not be enough .
Some kinds of animals would move to the urban area , steal the food from us and sleep on the streets or in the underground .
However , most of them might be arrested .only a little number of them might be adopted by those friendly human .
On the other hand , the expansion of city increase pollution of all kinds of garbage . The air pollution is much more serious now , and watching the blue sky is almost impossible in some big cities .
Although the medical skills get stronger , the percentage of people who get cancer is still improving .
In conclusion , the large - scale building projects take the living resource from animals , increase the possibility of getting cancer and so on .
Only if the government develop more technical property , pay more attention to the environment protection , such as build more trees and grass in the cities , and set a special low for those missed animals will help decrease the harm that the building project brings to us .
For me , my family members are not my best friends although I wish they are .
If they are your best fiends they will guide you and help you to be to be the best of you , they wo n't hurt you or turn their back on you .
But on the other hand you maybe punished or they may yell at you when you do something wrong .
So it is not always a good thing , unless they are open - minded or have their own methods to punish you in a gentil way that wo n't make you regret telling them your faults or mistakes .

Hello Sam .
Thank you very much to write me this letter .
Now , in order to answer your question , I have many favourite places near my town because I live in a lovely and little town , but there is one place taht is special for me : ' A Fervenza do Pedregal ' . '
A fervenza do pedregal ' is located in my town , Tomiño , in Spain .
It is a veri quiet place , because of its location , in the middle of the forest , only a few people know how to get there .
You can only arrive at ' A Fervenza ' walking or riding a bike , but it is impossible to get there by other ways .
It is an invledible forest place , the ground is full of low grass and there is a little river where you can swim , is is the perfect place to have a quiet day .
That is all I can tell you about this place . I hope tath my answer will help you with your project .

To combat the distriction of enviornment , this is a serious problem throughout the world .
Nowadays , many trees and grasses are damaged in many countries , lots of building are constricated .
And people should pay attention to this problem and try to slove it .
There are denying that the environment are changed by behavior of people and animals .
For instance , people need to many places to build the modern society , so they fall down lots of trees , burnning many glasses .
Another factor that the animals are not control themmselves to eat the plaints lend to distriction of ecosystem .
Nowadays , the transportation become more prefect , and the people'life become more convenient .
Althought this change lend the life of people efficient , the problem should not be ignored .
It would really be helpful if the government make tighter resrictions , in today 's world , lots of constrication companies and factories are not admission , they are destroyed the forest , farmland and wetland , charging waster water and emitting greenhouse gas , it lead to a serious enviorment problem .
So the government should oversee this companies , and if companies do not obey the rules or laws , it will be fined and closed .
Second , the government should publicize the awareness of protection
Taking the train is more cost effective than taking a car to work as petrol is costly and the new transportation office has reduced the cost of tickets to assist with the daily living expesnes we encounter .
The other benefit if taking public transport is less people are taking cars reducing the amount of toxic gases released into the environemnt .
Abortion is an immoral act that people make as everyone has a chance to survive and nobody has the right to decide for anyone life .
Abortion has to be taken seriously in order to avoid these immoral action as these fetus are being deprive of their right since they have already a life .
People had to be sensitize about abortion in order to decrease the number of women being abort .
Furthermore , abortion is very dangerous and a great number of women had been death with this .
Children has to be protected before and after life , it is why abortion has to be stop
In my opinion , I believe the public transport will have big role in the future due several reasons :
1- Inflation in population , the roads will not bear or endure huge numbers of cars .
2- I think on the future and transport and roads will be more organizing more than these days .
3- In the future people will concern more about energy , so transport will be more useful .
4- Transport more economical from independent cars .
5- Many people ca n't drive like children and old people .
6- Not everyone has the ability to buy a car .
Cause all these reasons I believe the transport will have big future .
From 1st Qtr to 2nd Qtr the sales increased by $ 100 .
Then , from 2nd Qtr to 3rd Qtr the sales increased by $ 250 .
Next , from 3rd Qtr to 4th Qtr the sales remained steady in $ 850 .
The last sales of the last year was $ 850 .
From 1st Qtr to 4th Qtr the sales increased by $ 350 .
karate is one of the best sports i have ever enjoyed in my life .One of the reasons behind my passion for karate is that it 's means of tamming the mind and the body .
I have learned to get control of myself when someone teaes me , and to be alert as well .Also , it helps to look always slim and put me away from the ghost of obesity as well .People who want to start playing karate have to be patient .
They should emerse themselves in daily exercises as well as eat healthy meals to keep them active .for instance , it 's adviced to eat great amounts of fruits and fresh vegetables because they contain a lot of vitamins that the body needs to work properly .
My favorite sport are football baskeball Formula One and Tennis .
I started to play football when I had four years .
My favourite team is Real Madrid and my favourite player is Cristiano Ronaldo .
He arrives to Real Madrid 5 year ago and he is the best player of the team .

I started to watch Formula One for my father these is his favourite sport .
Tennis is the favourite sport of my brother .
I played tennis with my brother , but he always won .
I played tennis with my brother , but he always won .

Hi Elena
How is going ?
Thank you for your letter !
What 's a big surprise , you are married .
My congratulations .
I got your beautiful postcard and your invite .
I 'm very pleased to your invite .
Now I 'm thinking about the present , what do you like ?
I look forward to hear from you .
Bye , Sandra
sports is very much beneficial for our health .
i would like to play football because it 's too much exciting game . in proportion to length it takes only 90 minutes . whenever i got the opportunity i played football .
Driving car while listening to music is much more fun for most of people so maybe that 's why mostly love to drive than taking public transport .
In contrary some guys hate getting caught in traffic jam so prefer public transport;some other reasons may be rising gas price , car crashes or hating driving !
As a result I thought both driving and public transport have their roles and we need to take each in the right situation .
I prefer to travel by train .
I have two reasons why I think so .
First , there are many kinds of types which train has .
For example , in our country , " Shinkansen " which measns burrett train is famous and very fast .
" Blue train " which has many beds in train and we can sleep comfortabully in train .
Thus , not only to ride but also to watch train is very interesting for me .
Second , travelling by train is safe and reasonable conpared to plane .
Recently although there are many LCC careers we can choice , it is still expensive to travel by plane .
TTravelling by train is cheep and getting chicket is easy for us in our country .
And terolism is scare also .
The plane which travel from Egypt to Russia was explosed by terolist in last month .
Compared to plane , train is relatively safe because it can move only on the land .
These reasons are why I think traveling by train is favourable .
Hello Julia ,
How are you ?
What did you do yestreday ?
I went to the cinema to watch a comedy with my friends yesterday , but I did n't like it because it was so boring .

what kind of films do you like ?
I like thriller and the action films because they have never been boring .
Do you prefer to watch films at home or go to the cinema ?
I prefer to watch films at the cinema because there are n't any distractions or noises and the quality of films are better .
See you soon .

Our earth is getting sick as days go by .
For example , air , water and land pollution .
There are several efforts that we can contribute in order to save the environment .
We start little by little to help it .
First of all , I want to emphasize on reducing the usage of plastics .
It 's the basic things and a habit that we can start easily from our own .
Plastics are non - biodegradable which degrade after 1000 years .
Non - biodegradable plastics could actually piles up the landfill and cause the land use in our earth to be occupied .
Besides , it destroys the marine ecosystem in such a way that the seabird or fish are fed on plastic .
This cause their reproduction system to be destroyed .
Hence , we should bring our own recycle bag or basket every time we go for shopping and resist temptation to get plastic from them .
Besides , we should use public transport or carpool in order to reduce the CO2 emission into the environment .
If the distance to destination is short , we could replace driving by walking or cycling .
That 's the descent way in reducing the adverse environmental impact and we are able to protect our Earth
Since GM crops technology started to be implemented it have implied in favourable socioeconomic changes .
This technique makes the weed control easier resulting in cost savings and yield gains , so that increase global production of crops such as corn , cotton , canola and soybeans .
he said kindly:"I buy you a present , open it , Tom "
Tom opened the big bag , Oh!This is a big surprise , there was a football in it , which he always wanted to buy
there were some words goal!keep doing ! keep looking!said her mom , Look !
there was also a cup in it , It said"don't give up your dream , keep doing!go!we stand by you!come on "
Tom love it , " thanks mom , thanks dad!"Today is the best day of my life , thank you ! "
" You deserve them , Tom ! you work hard all the time this year "
My name is Anna , i one of many new students at Ton Duv Thang university .
I 'm nineteen years old and from city but i living at domitory at Ton Duc Thang university .
It has 58 students : 18 boys and 40 girls .
I loves Ton Duc Thang university so much .
I likes the friendly students and helpful teachers .
I enjoys reading book , cooking , playing with dog and singing .
Moreover , i 'm loves music , i 'm often listen to pop music , R and B , and little Rap .
My favorite singer is Adam Livece .
These days people care about privacy and hence a personal car not only provides privacy but also convenience .
Hence , the new luxury cars are getting cheaper and powerful .
The speed of life has been fastened , people do n't have time to wait for a taxi or in the bus stop to get their work done , they want their work done in the blink of an eye .
So the need for bus has become unnecessary and our own cars are simply time consuming .
Everyone has a car .
Even kids started to learn driving at fifteen and most of the parents gift cars in their sixteenth birthday .
We can seen determine the future of transportation by differentiating the numbers of cars and buses .
Students have started to use their own cars than the bus .
So I think the future of public transportation is in darkness .
My favourite sport is cricket .
Cricket has become a part of me since when I was a kid .
Its very interesting sport .
Cricket brings a passion on me whenever and wherever its possible I find out a way to start the game .
I also watch cricket patiently .
Its known as the gentleman 's game .
The best part of this game is batting whether someone knows or not he first prefer to bat .
Batting has its own cherish .
So , I also prefer to bat and hitting hard rather than bowling .
Its very simple and wonderful sport .
If you play cricket you are surely going to burn many bad calories adhered inside your body .
In India cricket is worshipped and players are the lord .
The best part of this game is you can play with every age group at a single time .
I was very interested in making my career through this but due to my studies I ca n't take effort toward this .
So , if are going to play this sport do notice that there are some rules and be sure that you have all safety stuffs with you . Please do n't forget to take pleasure of batting first .
I hope you are going to play the best game on your part .
Next Monday , I am going to India .
I love India so much .
MY friend was travelling there , she was talking to me about it so much .
Indian people make an amazing food , but it 's so spicy .Indian people dance in amazing way .
India is the seventh biggest country in the world by area .
In India , it rains from June to September .
One day it was my dream to go there .
I am going to visit Delhi and Tajmahal .

Yes , I think it also can educate .
As times go by , technology is rapidly improving .
More and more gadgets are invented such as televisions , smartphones and so on .
There are lots of pros if we watch the television properly .
Using will not only gain the entertainment but also get the knowledge .
For instance , there are numerous program that we can choose .
It is a good time to turn to the entertaining program , when we feel bored and gaze the wall all the day .
Television provides educated varieties of channels as well .
Discovery channel is posture - oriented model example to educate .
We can learn how do the different animals feed on themselves .
Above the statements can ensure a rich and abundant live .
I think after 50 years many things will change . we will learn in our homes .
we won , t have schools .
we will do home works at home and send it to the teachers .
they will correct our tasks and send it again to us .
I think that we will order all we need on the internet .
There wo n't be super markets .
It wo n't be a post office because we can send any thing by the Internet .All jobs will be on Internet .
Every person will have a plane .
We will go to any place by plane .
We will have a robot servant .
They will serve us instead of human servant .
There will be any poor in the streets .
we will live happily .
I hope that the future will live peacefully and happily .
Hi , I am Amy . I would like to spend two months studying in English , two months doing volunteering in children charity and the least two months travelling in UK.What do you think of my plan?I will not only improve my English skills but also devote myself to get along with children .
The most important of all , I will take an adventure to the unknown place in UK.I am looking forward to seeing you soon .
I would like to invite you to join the road trip with me.it must be an amazing experience if we are together for this trip .
As long as you can go with me just let me know .
your friend Amy
My favourite sport is running .
I usually run in the morning , when my roommates are still sleeping , I get up and run in the playground .
I enjoy running , fresh air , warm sun and slight wind .
When I am running , all preesure I undertook has gone .
I am fill with hope .
I started running because I endured neck pain and my left leg is not comfortable when I sat all day .
Furthermore , I want reduce my weight as well .
I bought shoes , clothes and GPS watch , I told myself : now it is a challenge , I must defeat myself .The first day is so painful , I was tired to die when I just ran nearly 3 km , but things becomes better and better , and now I could run 10 km .
If you want to start running , firstly , you need a comfortable shoes and clothes , and secondly , make a plan , like how long should I run today , remember , appropriate rest is necessary .
Do n't make a goal that you ca n't reach , or you will lose your confidence soon .
the most important thing is your willpower .
First I will ask a question to you if this is your own house , you buy it with a lot of money and will you broke it with no reason ?
Of course the answer is no!Everyone knows that " Earth is our home."It is bigger than a house .
We have Eather first than people thanour house .
Eather is our home , we all have to protect it .
But now people are distroy it .
Just for mony for more house but if we destroy it we will all die our money will gone our house will gone we will have nothing .
Beside some people destroy farland to build houses but if one day there is no farmland than what should we eat?Nothing at that time we can eat nothing!So what should we do ?
Forest brings us fresh air bu8 t if there is no trees , what will happen ?
We ca n't breave we will die , too !
So my idea is aii the coutries allthe people stop to use farmland , forest andwetlang to build houses grow more trees portect our world , our homestar !
The lecture desagree with the paragraph , suggesting that the mention test developed by Alan Turing do not respond the mainly question : Can the computer think ?
First , the lecturer talks about " Saran " that propose a challange to prove that the Turing 's test was not conclusive , than he create a paradox .
He selected people to into in a chinese room , there was a computer in chinese language with diferente symbols , the american was a diferente behavior , they did not understand what was in the computer screen .
Different from the original test mention on the text , that all the participants were american and native speakers from that language , it was really easy to understand what was in the computer screen .
Second , the text support that the computers were evaluated by the own people that submited the test .
Not everyone can buy a car .
For many , there are other important expenses that need to be covered .
For example , for the young people in College the studies are more important , as well as books , seminars , travelling , etc .
Nowadays , Public Transport has become a very important way to go to work , to travel to other cities , or to simply go to visit a friend to the other side of the city .
I agree , for many people travelling by car is much more convenient , however , in my opinion , there is still a long future for public transport .
Dear Ronnie
I am happy to know about you .
Your plan sound great and I will be pleased to spend a few days with you and your family .
My grandmother is going to visit me in July so I would prefer suit you in August .
My smaller sister wants to go to the beach so that if she is not a problem she could come with us .
However she can stay at home .
I think it is more fun sleep together in your apartment . We could tell terror stories to each other at night , before sleep .
Maybe my sister could sleep in the studio .
I really like spend time on the beach but there are a lot of time so we could go to the swimming - pool if your parents say yes .
Too we could go to the bar to drink some juice or to go to eat an ice - cream .
Do not forget to write soon
Science , I just remember I always liked a car race , but one of my frevourite is a Formula 1 .
I like cars , and I like high speed that is why I love a Formula 1 races .
Formula 1 seson starts at erly spring and ends with a late autumn .
I try to watch every race every fournight and training a day before the race .
I like so much Ricki Rikonen , he is a ferrari team driver .
Ricki , is not the fastes driver on the track , but he drive very safety .
Ferrari making one of the fastes cars on the word , but this seson they are not so fast on the Formula 1 trac , how they were in the past .
If sameone like cars then should go to Formula 1 race to hear the bolid engine sound , I think that is the best voice which I have ever heard in my life .
Formula 1 it is also dangerous sport , the driver are exposed to the risk of accident at high speed .
I wish Good lack to all Formula driver !
Michael is one of the most important economist in the world , he wrote a lot of book about economy and finance in the USA and Europe .
He has decided to do a short essay about capital market abuse whereby he considered to travel to Italy and pick up some financial data from Italian central bank .
The key idea of this essay is the following : Italy in time of Berlusconi was almost entered bankruptcy however Michael is trying to avoid the Italian economy condition simply because he likes Berlusconi too much .
he received a lot of critics simply because many economists and econometricians in the world do not trust the source that he was used in his essay moreover they thought that he received money from Italian government .
After two years that his essay was released , he will understand that his essay was wrong moreover , Michael will want to apologise many people who read his essay thereby Michael now goes home , takes a cup of tea , goes to bed thus Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake
One day a man and his wife were trying to found a place shallow and without pollution for cultivate , they were poor ; they do n't have the necessary sources , but the husband work so hard because his wife had an accident it occurred one day that his wife was working in a campaign of conservation of animal in endangered , she went to a place in search of animals , she heard a sound in a dark place of the jungle so she went to investigated what was that , a creature that have never seen attack she , her partner only heard a shout and they found Lucy the wife of the man in the floor , they ask she if she is ok but he do n't answered so her partner toke it to the doctor , there the doctor said that she was ok but he will never hear again or only if she paid 1 000 dollar for a operation .

It is very easy to spend hours getting entertained by television .
However , it is more difficult to educate .
It depends how the presenter delivers the topic .
I have learned a lot from television .
There are excellent examples of good quality television on the BBC .
What 's more there are countries around the world that lack teachers to go to remote areas to teach , that rely on television to teach .
Mistake ! !
oh no ! !
How could I do this mistake ! !
These were my first feeling when I did the mistake .
Like every one , I was a normal person learning & improving day by day little by little from mistakes .
I am writing to suggest a few ways what our college can do for the environment .
Firstly , how can the college save energy ?
In order to reduce energy consumption should be made so that as much as possible lectures takes place in the day time .
This would reduce energy needed for the light sources .
Secondly , what sort of things can we recycle in the college ?
It would be a good idea to recycle paper , glass , metal and plastic .
In order to improve the sorting , there should be a litter bins for each mentioned substances in classrooms , corridors and outside .
Furthermore , the student and tutors should be encouraged to use public transport , cycling or walking .
Finally , all the student should be taught lectures about the environment .
I hope I find the answers to your question in my letter .
Yours sincerely

Seoul , in Korea , has many places to visit which places people want to visit .
I will introduce some good places to visit .
firstly , people who prefer youth culture , I recommend Hongdae .
Hongdae is most appropriate to feel free and vibrant local area in seoul .
there are a lot of club , pub and bar , cafe , karaoke and has more facilities which you will be able to enjoy .
Hongdae has many kinds of places thus , but you will be concerned about drunk people when the late at night .
At the late night in Hongdae , lots of people drink with their friends and walk around on the street with in drunken condition themselves .
So you need to be careful that kind of people .
and then , let me tell you another place ' Duksu palace '
. you can experience 19 century Korean imperial architecture and Korean traditional custom .
there was the place of the Chosun imperials queen .
The palace is in the middle of the city , therefore , you may feel different mood between 19 century and this day .
And also , there is gift shop and cafe .
I hope to enjoy your trip in Seoul till you left our contury .
Thank you for your reading .

In conclusion , before read the article I have never realized the importance of using drama in an English class .
For sure I will apply those strategies in my professional life , because drama gives to students the opportunity of not just learn something in the classroom , more than that , is the opportunity that they use their knowledge in the pedagogical and social life .
With reference to recent advertisement about ' USA CAMPAMENT SUMMER ' , I would like to express my interest in the position for the job in the campament .
I am a hardworking person and a fun girl .
I know to cook delicious meals .
I lived since two years in England and I speak English .
Recently , I had worked babysitting since one year in a school .
I felt very happy with this job .
I like do activities with them also I feed them .
I think so I am the suitable candidate for this job , because I like the children and I have experience babaysitting also I work very well making the food .
I will wait phone call you to discuss the possibility of arranging an interview .
The Wheel .
I choose the wheel because is the most useful invention ever because thanks to it the human works make easier by example a way to move heavy objects , compared to some of the fancy gadgets that we have today the wheel was invented at a relatively late point of human history , he oldest known wheel found in an archaeological excavation is from Mesopotamia .
In China , the wheel was certainly present in 1200 BC , for earlier Chinese wheeled vehicles , 2000 BC .
The wheel was found in a settlement built on stilts over wetland , indicating that the settlement had some sort of link to dry land .
( Taken from http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-technology/revolutionary-invention-wheel-001713 )
I would like to visit is Germany .
You can think ' why this ? '
It 's very simply .
In the school I study German and I like the language .
I think is a strong , maybe a bit hard to hear , but beautiful at the end .
My teacher told me some things about the country .
Added to what I know , make it attractive .
To this , we have to join the food and drinks ( who do n't think this ? ) .
Except estrange cases , who do n't like to prove the authentic German beer , or the Frankfurt sausages in the place where was invented ?
And the topic I like the most .
The History .
From Teutonic mythology to Hitler and the Second War World .
It 's an amazing history with lots of heroes and cries .
You can think anything but I think that is the better part of Germany .
Family plays an important role in our lives .
Family are the members that they never wo n't leave you alone , they give you love and happiness , they make your day!They are our best friends and family .
First of all , friends are important for us , we want a friend that we can share our secrets and problems .
But friends maybe in the future go away or hurt you!So you ca n't always based on them!For example , they need you until they find someone better than you and in the end they go away .
But family never let you go or family never go away from you !
However , the family is near you since the day you were born until forever .
The members follow you , and can based on them . You can tell whatever you want to them .
For example , if you are in a bad mood the first person that will come next to you , to make you smile is your mom or dad .
Mom and dad spent their life to grow up their children , to feed them , to love them !
In conclusion , Members of your family an important role in your life !
In the last years was improved the public transport system .
In the last edition of Pur Plus occurred an important discussion about the next plan of cities .
It presented a politician , an economist and two envirementalists .
They were talking about the problems of the public transport system and the results of new habits in this sector .
These people , those live in a city , do not take her own car or have not one .
This is a new age , which we live .
So will follow problems of these habits .
This makes me ponder , weather is a future of the old public transport system or should make a new system .
One argument of these topic , that more and more people live in cities .
There going to following some problems .
One of these are the jams .
Everybody own a car and nobody rent a car .
The car sharing system is n't common .
So will following more jams , if we do not change our habits .
The results , which will follow , will be the pollution of the environment .
So we need a new system .
There should be a ban of cars .
So we will stop the jam and so the problems of environmental .
But now we need more buses or another faster public transport systems .
But we should not forget , that these options do not alloy the environment .
Introduction
Have you drank under the legal drinking age in this past month ?
If yes , then you are one in the other 8.7 billion who have also drank under the legal drinking age . You may think that drinking underage will not do too much harm , but it can .
Teens should not drink under the legal drinking age because the teen could get into trouble with the law , the teen could cause harm themselves and others and can have a higher risk of alcohol dependancy later in there lives .
transport at Sudan is so expensive we suffer from the less and expensive transport here .
there are many kind of transport such as buses train and small cars called amgad an also taxi
This is an interested question becaus I beleive that my family is my best friends but at the same time they are not my friends .
My family is my best friends because they realy takes care off me when I needed them to .
They looks over me and help me when I am in troubles .
THis is important because it is important to have somebody to rely of .
But my family is not my best friends because you chose you friends but you do not chosen you family .
After all , family and friends are important .
The two maps show the changes which had taken place in the town of Shipsmouth between 1995 and 2010 .
Generally it can be seen that the city became more modern in 2010 than it before .
first of all , in 1995 shipsmouth was green residential city with two forests .
the two green area in the north - west and south - east concern had been replaced by apartment blocks and an airport .
No one can deny how much sport is very important to our life health .
my favourite sport is squash .
I start this sport since I was 10 years old.where my father was playing this sport also , but he started it when he was more greater than me , He was about 30 years old.where squash is one of the games that can be played in any age , I love this game because I find it making exercise to all the body in the same time , we are running in small place moving hands in stretched and different ways in the same time you are working your mind in the same time so it need caring and quik thinkink , as much exercise you will find down the road .
I think that any one wants to start sport can play squach which gives stretched and healthy body , in the same time this sport can be played for a long time of period without caring about the age .
squash sport also can be played individually as two players together or in team of 4 players.squash one of the very nice attractive sports
SWIMMING THE BEST SPORT IN THE WORLD
I have praticed swimming for 3 years , I am a good swimmer and I have competed in differents tournament of swimming .
The swimming is my favorite sport because in this sport I train all my body , is very relaxing and is the best sport in the world .
My favorite swimmer is Michael Phelps because He was the best swimmer in the world and I hope that He returns to olyimpic games at Rio de Janeiro in 2016 .
I need pratice for be the best swimmer in the world than Michael Phelps .
My favorite style is the butterfly and I always pratice this style because I want to improve .
I want to compete in United States in the most important tournament , in this competition participate the best swimmers of the world .
Some swimmers are Michael Phelps , Ryan Lochte , Peter Van de Hoogenband and others .
Nowadays it is easier to use the car instead of public transport .
Althouth public transport is cheep and more enviermental , they are not so flexble or comfortable as the car .
Exept for the big cities the public transport is not an easy way to move trohout the city , that means that in the future even more people will stop using it .
In these diagrams below , the manufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly .
The first step , the bank notes should be desinged concidering some constructions , like background color , artwork and security issues , After it was prepared , skilled machinists would make preparaation of metal plates in the second step .
Then , sheets of bank notes would be printed by 50 bank notes per sheet , which have colour imagines on both sides in special ink .
After printing well , these sheets would be manually inspected closely .
It was the most important step during the whole processing .
And then , some sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets which would be cut into and separated into equal ones andpacked and depatched to where they are demanded .
Another ones which were bad sheets and bad bank notes from damaged apparently , would be destroyed securely .
This was the whole working process of the bank notes and it was consist of 7 steps .
The sport is one of the best forms to be healthy and make some exercise .
You can play it with your friends and have a good time .
The most healthy sports are swimming , playing basketball , playing football or running but I prefer to play tennis .
My favourite sport is playing tennis .
I play it three times a week ( on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays ) in the club of tui .
I had been playing tennis from 2 years ago with two of my best friends .
I enjoy playing tennis because it is a sport that requires skills , concentration and speed .
I am not very good at all but I like to play it with my friends and do matches on Saturdays .
For new tennis players I recommend to know how to hold the racket , the position to hit the ball and how to put your feet .
They will have to concentrate on game and enjoy it .
In today 's class , we were discussing about wheather or not we agree to the common enourmous payed salaries of fooball Players .
For me , as a passionated Soccer Player , it is a good Point to consider .
I recommand to the Clubs , be warned .
For instance Christiano Ronaldo .
For him , as one of the top sheld payed Players of european leagues , it is no big deal to buy a Mercedes Benz .
He is arrogant .
He does not Need another one , but he likes the colour .
This way of thining he also Shows in game time .
He is not chasing after the ball , is not fighting enough to Keep it In the case he would really Need the Money , he would behave totally different .
What influences does this salaries have on the Clubs is quite simple .
They sell the tricots for 20 Euros more per Piece than last season .
By this aciton a Ronaldo or messie can be payed and it is possible to buy the best Team fo the league , like Bayern Munich is doing at the Moment .
But consider the reaction of the fans .
For them it is not possible anymore to rule for their Teams at any home game .
The tickets are to expensive .
The Anger will spoil over someday .
This makes Football or Soccer ever more equisite to a certain Group of fans - Hooligans .
As a result of These Action , it is an uncertain way to go for the Clubs .
If it stays on a certain Lever , no fan will complain about higher Prices .
But if the Prices will be to high , no onw would visit the games anymore .
The aim is to find a balanced way .
Business in My Home Country
In my home country , there are many different kinds of business culture and custom .
For example , restaurant business and technology industry is totally different in Taiwan .
In these 10 years , Taiwanese have become enjoy our life , so many people like to drink coffee or have an afternoon tea .
That is why many business men want to win in this competition , so they created so many bargain activities , like if you check into places , you will buy one get one free .
Apparently , restaurant business is creative and marketing - orientation in Taiwan .
In contrast , there are two different type of company in the technology industry .
One is original equipment manufacturer , like Foxconn , workers in the company always need to do the same thing and the executive in Foxconn also always need to bargain with Apple or Samsung .
Although they produce high quality products they receive a little money and have high pressure in work .
The other one is original brand manufacturer , like htc , they produce a lot of new smartphones and sell it .
In three to four years ago , htc makes so much money in the Europe , Taiwan and Japan .
The company likes to produce new products and use high salary to hire great talents .
So htc became more energetic and bold in making innovation .
In Taiwan , many young people want to enter htc .
Finally , Taiwan still suffers economic slump , but we have so many businesses likes to innovate , market their product , customers likes to buy it .
I think Taiwan will be recovery in the near future .
One evening , it was a blistering hot day that I still should attended , one of my friends , a wedding ceremony .
I was dressed in nice suit , going to this party .
There were so many people talking to each other .
I did n't want to chat with them first .
Consequently , I drank the alcohol on the table , looking for , my friend , a bride .
I wanted to know how beautiful the woman was .
As soon as the bride appeared in front of us , most people kept silent abruptly .
I glanced at the groom jealously .
How lucky he could marry her .
I maintain a good - looking face , keeping fit .
It was ridiculous that I did n't have a girlfriend .
I prefer having a nice gorgeous girl live with me to living alone .
However , I still did n't have a girlfriend .
I was overwhelmed with grief .
I could not stand looking at them , celebrating .
Accordingly , I drifted to the party , going home alone .
However , I was too dizzy to go straight so that I took a ride .
I fell asleep immediately .
The driver set me to a place where he know .
When I woke up , not doing know why I stayed the police office .
Dear Mrs Kate Asbhy ,

In addition I love dealing with people , I 'm very sociable .
On the other hand I 'm used to work long hours as a matter of fact in holidays I had worked in many restaurants .
I hope your answer soon .
Best wishes
Patricia
one day Micheal wanted to go out from his home so he called his besfriend an suggested to go out togther , his friend agreed , so Michael weared his closes , wnet out and closed the door but at this moment he knew he had made a mistake .
he forgot the key inside the home !
what should he do ?
hw went to his father in the company and get the another copy of the house key .
when he get back to the home it was late and the metting was canceled
It is very true .
There is no future for public transport .
But not so many people have a driver license .
They have to use public transport .
The public transport can connect people .
You can meet every kind of people .
It 's some kind of socializing .
The public transport is cheaper than the car .
hello , my name is victor and I am going to talk to you about myself .
I know that I am a suitable person for this job , and I can say that nobody is better than me for this incredible job , because I have been travelled for all the world and in this experience , I have seen in the necesity on work to fiance my journey , so the I have dedicated to work on summer camps , and I have a lot of experience in this .
I have other qualities like , cooking like super chef or even better than that , I am the person more organizated in this country , and I love to work with children because it is a form to teach everything you know to other people and help to improve like person .
I always do exercise , in the morning I like to running on the beach , at the evening I like to go to the gym and at night I love to swim in my own swimming pool .
so in conclusion , I think that if you contract you , you will get an axcellent people and an excellent worker
I think it is true that the public transport there is not future , because travelling by car is so much more comfortable .
In my opinion the public trasnport is more expensive and it is less comfortable that the car , because the car is faster that the public transport .
The public transport do stop more time that the car , this transport go direct to its destination .
Today the people use the application " blah blah car " .
it is an application that the people use for save gas and money .
I believe that the people in a future they will begin to travelling shared car more time and they use less the public transport as the train , the bus , underground , etc .
The problem that I saw with this , It is that in the future will be more pollution , because there will be many cars .
Online Lerning
Positiv things about the online lernign are dat you are more mobile with your smartphone and you do nt have to carry so much paper with you , also your on your own and in your own lerning speed what makes it more spesific on the user it selfs . maybe your more confortable on your Smartphone then with papers .
Negaticvs about the online lerning are dat your not listening to much from ea real person and more from a Computer , if you do nt have any listening things in the app you do nt lern how to pronounce the words . in my personal obinionits better to lern froma teacher not only dat you lern to pronounce the words correctly you also lern from a personwhat is in my opinion way better i thin k we spend enougth time on smart phones so i do nt think its the best if we use them to lern as well .
For words i think its perfect but all the grammer and talking i think you need a teacher .
I love Grey 's Anatomy , this is supposed to be a medical drama , but I am sure this show has been beloved because of the soap opera drama parts .
Therefore , I would like to highly state that Grey 's Anatomy is my favorite soap opera .
The show seems difficult , the characters always have to face the situations which is uneasy to solve , but practically , this show is a soap opera in hospital .
I used to think I never liked soap opera , because it was boring , out of date and unworthy to watch , but this was just prejudice .
My mother also like this show .
Today 's television is really good .
It shows you movies , news and the new products .
The advertisements are a bit tricky because they know exactly when children watch , for example sfter School .
And then they just show products specially for children .
So at a Special time is a special advertisement for this age group .
But it also shows the new products .
Advertisement is important for the economy .
Exept some good movies they also show a lot of rubbish .
Or sometimes you see during the day horror movies which should not be .
Who wants that their child sees this ?
Of course you can make a child lock on the TV but when you look hard enough for some you will find any .
Every day they show the news .
So you know what is going on in the world .
I think they show it four times a day .
I would say if you know how and when to use a TV it is good but specially for young people who think it is a good entertainment to watch the whole day .
The TV people know what to play that the children get addicted to the TV .
Attitude about schools in Colombia and Australia .
The attitude of Colombians about the educations system is disappointing in some areas and optimistic in others .
In the same way Australians have a different attitude about their education system .
However the attitude of the Colombian and Australian people is different in many ways .
In Colombian some people have a high attitude about education but there are some others that have a very low attitude .
This is because in Colombia there are a lot of social - economic levels which make people to have a different and divided attitude toward education .
Similarly , Australians have a different attitude about the education system .
This is depending on the believes and the cultures of the people .
This attitude is more based on the backgrounds of the people rather than the system itself .
Today I am very exciting because on Sunday I will go to Bangkok .
I go with my older sister , daddy and mommy .
We will have a good time there .
I will eat tokyo , my favorite dessert .
We enjoy so much .
Recently , there is a growing country whose environment is destroyed by building house , which accour for some debation .
Many would argue that its disadvantages have already dispersed advantages , and many others veto this view .
With the tremendous thriving and growth of both economy and cultural diversity , the need of the resource is increading , which used for building much - needed housing and transport networks .
Apparently , it is a good thing , because it is a significient symbol for the development of a country ; however , on the other hand , doing large - scale building projects may bring a galaxy of probems .
In the first place , the environment is destroyed , because there are some tresses and flowers before buliding the house .
What is worst , the room of the house where some animals lived before , so they lost their houses , which become the houses of people , nevertheless , the earth is not only belonged to the human .
Secondly , building more houses not so much because of living by people , but more because of the economy , which is used for building speculation and the price of the house is too expensive to buy for public person .
For example , some people who have lots of money living in shenzhen earn more money by buying low price and selling high price , although they have house to live .
Also , it is reported that Chinese investors have driven up housing prices in Vancouver by 12% .
Therefore , no longer on the acts go unheeded , and the governments have to deal with these problems . We should forbid the acts by setting certain law .
In a word , the government may appeal in some way , that we should protect the earth rather than only facus on personal profit .
Nowadays people usually use the car all the days , actually for most of the diary things ; despite the fact that there is small amount of people that travel in public transport .
The cars pollute big amounts of carbon dioxide , so that is the result of the grey skies of some cities like Madrid Beijing or New York are grey and this has to change .
Using the public transport is " healthier " than the car for the environment because inside the bus can travel twenty three humans and is only one vehicle , however it would be twenty cars .
Also people think that travel in cars is faster than in public transport and I agree with it because the bus or the underground is always stopping in the different stations , so in this way the car is better .
In my opinion , I will use the public transport , not always but more than the car although you travel slower because I want to save our planet , that the rising generations can live in good conditions .
My favourite sport
I have been playing tennis since I was a teenager and for that reason tennis is my favourite sport .
The main reason by which I like playing tennis is because I can control the amount of exercise that I can do .
Tennis is not a coletive sport .
There are necessary just two players and if you get tired and lose a match no one is going to be responsible but yourself .
That 's why you can control your limits .
Besides , you do not need a lot of people , as on football match for example , to play tennis .
Sometimes it is difficult to join so many fellows to practise a coletive sport .
Undercontrary , on a tennis match you need just one , does n't matter if man or woman .
The exception is in a match of double .
Even that you have to find only three more players in this case .
But , although all these advantages , the tennis player has to take care with some dangerous situations .
For example , never starts a match without a warm up because you can suffer serious muscular injury .
It happened with me once and was very unconfortably .
Another very commom risk is to fall on the square which can cause dangerous scratches .
In despite the risks , I recommend this sport for everyone who has a good physical condition .
Buy a good racket , wear a pair of good shoes , find someone to practise and start to enjoy .

Dear Paul
Last month I helped host a concert in Timisoara .
I was the boy behind the curtain , I dealt with the sound of the concert due to my experience in professional music equipment .
I encountered during the concert small problems but we have fixed very easy thanks to the team with whom I have worked .
Pleasure to work at concerts is when I look in front of the stage and see different classes of people with different ages starting from the young and the elderly who forget all your worries and enjoy the same concert as if not and be separate .
The experience is an unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert .
Your friend Pogan
When they were together , they knew that his history was about to finish .
They could live with this fact .
People surprised to know his relation was broken for so long .
They seemed happy to share their life .
Never nobody heard any discussion .
They always were so friendly , and so kind ... that was strange image that end But that was the sad reality .
Then had to decide with who would stay their cat .
They met with the layer .
They presented arguments to get the custody and the layer listened them very carefully to decide they can not have the cat .
The cat had to go to the animal residency and they had to pay the expenses .
The meeting ended .
Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake
Michael made a very bad mistake ....
There are the most bad mistake that he does in all your life ....
Her mom would kill him !
But first , I will tell you all the story since the beginning .
Michael was a boy very intelligent .
He was the best student in her class .
The boy had a mother .
Mia that was her name .
She always asks to Michael to never disrespect when people are at the door and always be polite .
Mia could n't accept when some behave badly .
And Michael said every time that he never will do that .
But , one day day , Mia think that she could do a test .
She would get dressed as an old woman .
So she said to Michael that she would go shopping and she would return soon .
Then she put her cover of an old woman and took her way home .
Getting there , she knocked on the door .... Michael open the door and Mia ask if he has a cup of water to give him and he says way he would give a cup of water to an old people .
In this moment , Mia took away her cover and Michael sad :
OMG !
These is the most mistake I did in all my life !
The building was initially planned as the Federal Legislative Palace during the regime of Porfirio Díaz , because the society was governed and supported for the president .
In later time , society feel the need for change about iniquities that pass in the country and the Mexican Revolution explotes , the building is abandoned because the government and country do nt have money for construction , to the point the building metal estructure was used as weapons .
After the revolution , construction will use for represented the win of revolution
Almost every family have a car now .
They use these car to travel , for shopping , to drive to work .
It is so much more convenient .
Only in the big city , people use public transport to will not be traffic .
My mother and my father had a fight to each other , they wanted not together .
They even asked me , I wanted to go with who , they grabbed my hands , wanded me go themself , but I had no idea , because I love my mother and my father so much .
I wanted we can live together forever , they taked care of me , loved me , we lived in the same house , we had a happy family .
I thinked these things .
Finally , I cried , because I could n't decide a choice , my father and my mother saw I cry , decided not keep going , and they saied sorry to each other and me .
Hi Peter !
How are you ?
I 'm happy for you !
I agree with your parents , maybe you could spend your money with something you really need and maybe you can buy computer games with the money you have left , or maybe you put aside money to buy something really important to you .
If I were you I wait to spend the money .
Let me know what you decide .
See you soon .
When I was at university student , I wanted to swim well but I could n't swim . because I did n't have to swim in my life .
so I decided to learn swim for summer vacation .
First , I registered a swimming pool then I went back to the swimming pool every day in the early morning .
After 6 months I could swim well until now .
so I satisfied my decision at 13 years ago .
Nowadays I usually went back to the swimming pool in the weekens .
Sometimes I got rid of my stress .
I thoght the swimming was the best of sports in my life because you can use your body muscle everything .
So you could a lose weight and gained muscles .
Some of my friends they did n't want to shown their body by someone . because a lot of students did n't have exercise .
We did n't have to enough time today .
but I always said my friends " If you want to have fit body , you will register swimming pool .
" So many friends learend to swim .
Dear Dana ,
Thank you for sending the AA Report to us .
The report was discussed at our meeting , and we wish to congratulate you on completing this audit and providing the details and evidence on improving the outcomes from students results in this year .
One straight observation was the low number of students that have taken the math course .
We wondered if some work need to be done to increase the student attendance in the math courses .
The diagram gives information about various stages in the process of making bank notes .
It is true that there are five stages in the whole process.we can see that the processes begin with design and end at packaging and distribution .
looking at the information in more detail .
Initially , bank note should be considered the design such as background colour , artwork , and security issues.then,the preparation of metal plates is next stage.bank note should be skilled and machinists.thereafter,this stage is printing .worker should pay attention to colour on both sides , special ink , and images slightly raised .
subsequently , this step is most important.bank note should be inspected.bank notes separated into good and bad if get good quality sheets , the next stage is packaging and distribution.at this stage sheets should be cut into separate bank notes , packed , and dispatched . if get bad sheets.the nest stage is disposal.band sheets and bank notes securely destroyed .
The diagrams show bank notes how to make , there are four steps to make the bank notes .
First , the bank notes are designed by consider , thinking from background colour , artwork , security issues .
Then , the metal plates are preparated by skilled machinists .
And then , the sheets are printed , operator should pay attention to the colour on both sides , special ink , and images slightly raised .
Third , this is the most important step that printed sheets manually inspected , the this sheets are classified three areas .
The number one called good quality sheets , they will be packed and dispatched .
The next called partially damaged shees , and bank notes separaed into good and bad , good sheets will be cutted into separate bank notes and packed , the bad one will be destroyed by fair .
The number three called bad sheets , they will be securely destroyed .
This a method of making bank notes , and the operater should pay attention to the printed sheets how to inspect .
These pictures obviously show us what detailed steps of the bank to produce paper money into the application .
Before the production , they should think about the cover , including background color , artwork and codes which make it different from the illegal ones , then put them into the printing machines to create them .
On the top of the steps is the inspectation by hands , that is to say , they should be separated into well - qualified ones , which are to be cut into bank notes , and delivered to the banks and the bad ones which ca n't be utilited are fired definitely at the last stage .
In a words , the processing of making money to banks is very creative and serious , even rigid .
I know that we can post anything that we want but not like this .
Wake up world .
Look at you .
Rise your nose from your phone , and look at all these nice things that the life is giving us .
Read a book or play football if that is what you like .
We are architects of our own destruction .
We have to live our life .
You ca n't live only on Facebook .
YOLO !
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE !
I think public transport do n't lost .
for example me , I do n't have a car thus I usually use a train in my school .
I think that is enough .
If I will go travel I think a car is very useful . but Movement of long distance is very tire .
Consequently , you ca n't fun travel .
Children ca n't get a car license thus children use Public transport .
Of course , Do n't have a car license people ca n't drive a car .
Accordingly , I think need public transport .
I think that members of our family ca n't be our best Friends , because maybe we do not have the same confidence that we have in our Friends .
For example , maybe you have a personal situation , that is very important to you , but you do not want your family know about it , so you decide to tell your best friend , because you know she wo n't tell anybody .
I think it depends on the situation , on the other hand , your sister or brother , can be one of your best Friends , you can tell them important things , but ask them not to tell your parents .
I 'm studying Business Administration , I think my major is so busy .

I 'm dreaming to be an Business Administrator when I 'll be older , firstly I want to work an a sports company lik UA and then I may have a little variety on works .
Finally I hope to get my own business .
Family members are the people who will company us in our whole life .
Compare to our classmates or co - workers , the members of our family know us the most .
They know what our habits are , what we think about and what we like to eat .
Family members are the most important and best friends in our life .
First of all , family members are those who will keep in touch forever , so they know our habits the most .
Moreover , they know how to interact with us . They can make you happy , cheer up your mind and always support you when you are in trouble .
Secondly , family members always know what we are thinking about .
Families realize our mind so much ; However , our classmates or companies ca n't reach that because they do n't stay with us all the time .
Only families can know us the most because they live with us when we came to this world .
Final , family members will always prepare the food you like to eat .
They always give you what we like to eat .
In addition , they always supply much food to us so that we wo n't stay hungry .
Besides , eating with our families are one of the most happiness things in our life .
In conclusion , only family members know what we are most deeply .
Also , family members are the people that we will always want to stay in contact forever .
Because of the reasons above , we can say that the members of our family are our best friends !
Tennis , tennis is not jsut a sport anyone can play but it 's professional sport needs to more hard trainee and more time to be perfect in it , in first why I choose tennis ? , seriously in 2003 this is my first time to watch the game on TV when I saw roger federer played I think he is the one that made me love this sport , due to it 's professional motion in playing the ball , from this time I was interested in this game and watching all championship , so more time , time and time it was my favoirite sport .
my advice is be patient , be smart this sport not easy but it 's need more trainee , more time to be one of the greatest player in the game
MY BEST FRIEND
I met my best friend , Aisha , at a friend 's in common party six years ago , when we were 25 .
While I was dancing she pushed my by accident , she did n't noticed it so I thought she was an arrogant person at first .
But , when our friend in common introduce her to me I realized that she was a funny and nice person .
Aisha is a funny girl , she is always making jokes , and she really knows how to have fun .
Her parties are always the best .
She loves dancing and she is really a party animal .
She is also a good listener , she always know what to say in a bad moment and she is always there when a friend is in trouble .
Aisha is in his therties .
She 's from Marocco , so she has Arabian features , for example , she is n't very tall , around 1,57 metres , she has long dark wavy hair and black expresives big eyes .
She is tanned and has a slim complexion .
Dear Redaction ,
I have just read , that you need reviews of soaps opera .
I have one favourite soap opera .
This is a ' Beverly Hills 90210 ' .
I love this film , because it shows teenagers life .
And I like see how they look like .
I like their style and live .
They learn at school , they have problems with each other , they fall in love , have parties .
Most of all I like Brenda , because she is a smart , beautiful person .
And she wears the best clothes ever !
I would like to be like she .
I think that a lot of people can learn how to live , what think , eat , wear from this soap opera .
My best friend is my sister .
Although I have 5 members of my family but just one from 5 is my real friend .
She did a lot for me , my life
.
In my opinion , that is not a logical statement which jibes with the fact .
First of all , although travelling by car become more convenient , the growing population which cause personal vehicle is hard to manage .
The traffic jam becomes more and more serious as far .
Such as Beijing , the metropolis in China , faces the salient bad traffic as such government had to encourage the citizen go to work by public transport such as bus and subway .
Apparently , this method has made a great contribution to the traffic in Beijing .
So , the public transport is playing an important role in our daily life , It shows an indispensable effects on the society work .

Introduction
The aim of this report is to inform the committee about the attractions of this town .
The report is based on the opinions and ranking of people and critics that have been visiting these places .
Town center
In the town center there are most attractions as well as one of the best bars in the region " the Albastirca " .
Many visitors come to it but there are more attractions than only one bar .
There is a giant park which maybe the visitors would be delighted to visit as it has animals , a funfair and a lake .
Pluses
What 's more about the town is that it is n't lacking shopping facilities .
It has a big mall that has been recently opened up , and it contains everything the visitors might need .
On the other the mall lacks a cinema or some restaurants as it has been recently opened .
Conclusions
To sum it up I strongly suggest that the visitors stay as much as possible in this town as it has almost everything that a man needs .
Some people say there is no future for public transportation but I do n't think so .
People who believe it do n't care about air pollution and traffic .
Lima is a small city where there is no more space for another car .
Moreover , it is more approppiate to start constructing roads which were convenience for the majority .
first my favorite sport is futboll and i like for many reasons for example while you are watching a match you 're going to feel exited and entretaining besides that fubol has the best fotboll player than ever who is leo mesy he 's the best and he s able to awesome stuff when he 's playing .
Yesterday morning a group of American tourist went to a bike ride for through the center of Buenos Aires City .
One of them was intercepted by a man on a motorcycle , he seemed to have 28 year .
The mas was armed try to steal the backpack .
But he not be fixed that the man was a camera in his head and hi action was filmed .
He was furious because the American do n't understand what he would say .
The tourist was surprised to see a gun , the robber forced the man in the street and then the tourist put to run .
He was very lucky because the gunman returned to pick up his motorbike and keep his gun .
The man run to where his friends and sought a police .
They found a police near it and made the complaint , the group continued the bike ride and returned their hotel totally scared .
After two days and with the help of the filming the gunman was captured and brought to justice .
Now he was arrested and charged before a magistrate for the robbery , waiting for his sentence .
The tourists return to his country very scared .
How can I start ? should i start with speaking about myself or about my country or about my family or about my life ?
It is hard for an eastern girl to do what she likes because of her society 's traditions and customs .
Let 's take me as an example , I am a 25 years old girl who is graduated from faculty of engineering and want to travel to Germany to complete my study but I am not able to do this because my family will not allow me to travel alone .
I am trying to change my family 's opinion so that I can travel .
College is the only place where i feel I am special that is why i always like to there .
How we treat the earth has a direct impact on ourselves .
Today , because of our progress of industry , we produced so many environmental problems that had n't appeared before .
For examples , lack of purity water , shortage of electricity , climate change , natural source depletion , and etc .
The problems were n't so significant that we overlooked them , but now they become serious threats that we ca n't ignore .
How can we solve these problems ?
Just change your daily habits .
There are so many questions .
Who we are ?
What do we do ?
Why we make mistakes ?
There is no clear answer but the sure thing is we are humans .
As a nature of human , we would make mistakes .
But we should n't make same mistakes .
If you wrong , I will fix you and if I wrong , please fix me .
Anyway , we would make mistakes , if we do the new challenges and new tasks .
We have to fix it all again .
Introducion :
The aim of this report , is to show how does my town takes care of the environment .
Home rubbish :
The mayor , in collaboration with Lipor , distributed leaflets with information on " How to deal with household rubbish " .Each leaflet explains how to separate the home rubbish .
Instead of putting the rubbish in one trashcan , the families should separate it in three different groups - papers , glasses and plastics - and put it into the correct eco point .
The company responsible for rubbish collection collects of the garbage , already separated by the families , and afterwards does the recicling .
How does the town treats the environment :
The City Hall is very concerned in keeping the area cleaned .
In spite of the informative sessions about the enviorenment , organized by the Mayor for all of the residentes , it also has lots of staff that cleans the streets , take care of the city gardens and collect the garbage .
Eco friendly :
In conclusion , I would like to say that the city where I live maintaines the city cleaned and attractive , for people that live there and for those who visit the city .
I do believe that the members of my family are my best friends for many reasons.first of all , we got the same education as we grew together we know each other .
If I suffer from any problem the first step I do is I try to go back to my lovely sister because deep inside I know she is only member that can assist me .
Secondly , if I need money I will come back to my brother or sister I ask them to borrow some money .
I think public transport has good prospect in the future according on following reasons .
First , the trend of environmentally friendly has grown since the shortage awareness of fuel , taking public transport can decrease the air pollution by car , and more governments had build the public transport system including subway , buses etc .
The transport in the city is n't inconvenient as years ago .
The other is , travelling by car is n't convenient if you go to the famous resorts , most famous resorts lack of parking lots , travelers may spend hours to park .
On the contary , people who take the public transport can more enjoy the travel because they do n't waste vitality on driving .
To summarize , because the development of public transport is more and more complete , the advantage of travelling by car was placed by public transport gradually , the future of the public transport is bright .
My favourite sport is football .
It gives me many a positive energy and fun .
I have played for 12 years .
I am not a professional player .
I play just for yourself
Sometimes If I would like to play football but it rains I can watch football on television .
If I play with my best friends at football I will be a goalkeeper .
In football my favourite position is goalkeeper .
It is really hard to give some advice .
We have to be very patient .
My advice is only one .
If you practise you will achieve skills .
In Somalia , people usually throw the rubbish and garbage in everywhere , and there is no a cycle which intended to keep it .
The city council are tackling with how they can keep the city clean , and each and every morning there are employees whose work are to collect and keep the environment clean .
Many of the main roads of Mogadishu are getting attractive by the day and the people begun to make their city clean .
Swimming is my favorite sport , I usually swim 2 or 3 time a week , swimming is a good sport especially in summer .
Study says the cool water will cool the body temperature down and that means it will burn the body fat fast then the other sport .
The other advantage of the swim is the less impact the knee .
Swimming will be the good exercise to the people who are not able to jog or even walk .
By the way , some people do n't like to swim because they have difficulty finding the swimming pool , I think that just an excuse to be lazy , the Internet will help you to find out .Lets go to swim .
FOOTBALL_MY FAVORITE SPORT
Nowadays , there are many choices to spend in our free time such as go shopping , travelling , listen to music , reading , etc ..
But to me , I choose playing sport in my free time .
Football - the most popular sport in the world , is well - known as " King Sport " .
There are two teams and each team has the same amount of players : maybe 6 , maybe 7 and maximum 11 .
The objective of the game is to score by kicking the ball into the opposing goal .
Actually , I began to play football when I was 10 years old .
I play football in my free time until now .
There are many reasons why I enjoy football .
My first idea , football make us stay in shape , avoid some diseases .
A second idea , It helps us make new friends when I take part in some football team .
I have relationship with people who are playing football with me .
They not only help me in every match but also share me everything in daily life .
A finally idea , football makes us enjoy our life and increase quality of life so far after working hours .
Eating a balanced diet is something very important for anyone especially for pregnant women , children and old people as their bodies need more nutrition than younger people .
Although balanced diet will offer energy and vitality but that 's not all of the thing , Exercising is important too in addition to the balanced diet .
My favourit sport is football i love it so much when i was young i used to watch football and my favorite team is Barcelona i was play with my friends at the street and we was happy with that so much and after that we played at playground like really football i love Cristiano Ronaldo so much he is the best player at the world a few people telling me that messi is the best player but i feel angry when i hear that because that is not true so i looking forward to meet my best player one day its like a dream to me .
I think the alcohol is the most dangerous addiction all around the world .
Because many people have died for this , and it 's really hard to stop this addiction even if the person wants to stop it .
my favorite sport is swimming
i swim 2 times per a week
sometimes i go to the swimming pool in the same area which i work there and sometimes i go to the swimming pool of my cousin ,
i enjoy when i spend my time in the water and now even i am pregnant i am afraid when i swim with a group of people i keep telling them and screaming do not close with me ! ! !

When I read your e - mail I was very surprised about it .
Well , I think it is really creative .
If you want to visit me you have to do it in the next month because I have a football tournament , and I must participiate .
So what about next month , 12th of December?I would like to suggest a dish named " Bloody Liver " .
It could be strange for the others , but it is really delicious if served with corn .
If you want to visit a restaurant , I would suggest the Dagi .
It is a bit far from my home , behind the fuel station once we left your car .
To answer your question , I can not attend the party beacuse I do not like theese kind of parties , but I wish you good luck!Almos
We the management of The Arch London Hotel received your mail and wishes to let you know that you should make known to us the position you desired to work in via return mail along with a scan copy of your signed contract of agreement to enable us make every necessary corrections .
Thank you .
When it comes to public transport , the future is relatively dark according to the prospection .
Indeed all the indicators show that humain behavior will not change at least in the following decades .
Car continues to attract people .
In the other hand , Governments are not able to change transportation policies to enhance public transport level of service .
Malaga is a town that takes care of the environment .
Around the city , there are a lot of containers for rubbish , pieces , plastic and crystal .
All people has very close someone to recycle .
Also , you can put clothes and shoes that you do n't need it for Africa children .
So , Malaga is responsible with the environment and with people with more necessities .
Secondly , in Malaga there are strong and hard rules for factories .
These companies must take care of the environment or they would have to pay big tax at the council .
So , in general , I think Malaga is very responsible with the environment and acts in consequence .
The way of livng change everyday : if we think about our grandparents ' , but also about our parents ' life , we notice many differences .
Above all they talked more : we live in the era of the telecomunication and none could live without their mobile phone or their computer .
Be always in contact with our friends has become our way of living .
Moreover also simple things are changed , for example the food we eat : some times ago everythingh was natural , healthy ... but now everyone eat always " junk food " and thinghs like that , which are completely unhealthy !
However , How will people 's life change in the next 50 years ?
As a result of what I have just said , in my opinion people wo n't have a " really life " : everyone will be always more involved in the virtual life so that they will forget how to talk each other and how express own feelings !
About the foods , I imagine a future society in which restaurant wo n't exist : people will eat only junk foods and food , which has been prepared before , food in tin ... so all unhealthy thinghs , which will cause many problems .
For this reason I also imagine that in the future doctors and scientists will have so much to do !
Do not ruin our life , it could be all so perfect !
My favourite sport is soccer .
Also , we can learn to help each other in the team .
My favourite trick is nutmeg .
My favourite soccer player is Frank Lampard .
My favourite team is Chelsea FC .
My favourite soccer pitch is Hong Kong Stadium .
My favourite soccer is the Brazuca .
I started soccer when I was four .
I often play soccer with my father and my brother .
When it is holiday , my brother and I play soccer twice a week .
It is really good to play soccer !
Everyone is afraid of something .
A lot of people are afraid of catastrophic events even thought it 's very improbable that the same thing will happen to us .
Some fear are instinctive and it 's positive because it protect us from real danger , it 's a good response .
But the phobias are which we experience that are life - threatening and they can distrupt everyday life , but people can get over with the right sort of therapy .
So if we want to live a life which is n't controlled by our fears , we must try to be more objective and pay mre attention to the real dangers .
We should spend less time worrying and more time being happy !
In 1898 , H.G. Wells wrote his story ( the war of the worlds ) , so it was inevitable ; people began to see space creatures everywhere .
Science fiction magazines and stories spread .
And the flying saucers ' culture has dominated . They will be green in color .
They will have three eyes , antennas over their heads , and guns firing green extraction .
They want to occupy the planet Earth because , according to them , our resources are still virgin ..
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediatly put on her coat .
Alison put on her coat , close the door and went to his parents house by car .
She went to his parents house because they sent her an email that said that his father is okay after the oparation .
When alison knock on his parents door she noticed that there were many people in her parents house , a man open the front door .
When she entered the house , a man was looking at her with a bad face , when suddenly this man shot with a gun to Alison father .
Alison left the house very scared , it was a dream .
Nowadays , public transport is used for many people in the cities , we can find different types of them , such as bus
tube and train , but is there a future for it or not ? , I am going to respond this question giving disadvantanges and advantages and finally I give my personal opinion .
To begin with , Public transports is not as comfortable as using our own vehicle , every day , about all in the morning , it is usually crowded , due to people than begin to work .
Secondly , moving in a city in public transport could be horrible , there are too many station , and we spend a lot of time on them until we arrived at home .
Although I have written some disadvantages , public transport is better than private .
Firstly , if anyone want to move in the city using the car , that could be very expensive , due to traffic jam .
Secondly , Public transport is more ecological and less polluted with the enviromment , so as it is producing less polluted fume , and many of them use green energy , such as electricity or gas .
In conclusion , from my point of view , public transport is more necessary now than never before , cities contains more automoviles and the pollution is worse , we need to change our mind , and try to use them as other alternative to improve the enviromment of our cities .
Last week , my class and I went to Sicily for a schooltrip .
we visited many cities .
the first day we went to Taormina and Giardini Naxos , the day after we visited Siracusa , the third day Agrigento and The valley of the temples and the last day we saw Marsala and Trapani .
I enjoyed all the cities we saw but the best in my opinion is Siracusa . in particoular I liked Ortigia that is the oldest part of the city .
I also liked the Valley of the temples of Agrigento so much : it was amazing .
I think that the worst thing of the trip is that the last night in our room there were a lot of insects and some spiders and we must change Room .
public transport now a days has become a bit uncomfortable because we can not think of availability of seat .
large number of people use it which results in over - loaded buses and trains .
it take too much time to travel by public transport than by personal vehicle.there is scarcity of buses in public transport and there timings too are not fixed .
traveling by car or any other personal vehicle is too much more convenient because it takes too much less time and it takes us directly to the place where we want to go .
In a recent time privet transport is more convenient than public transportation , although public transport like buses , train , ferries and intercity rail are consuming less time and energy but sometimes its create problems .
In public transport people bound to share transport means with strangers and also we have to persue company policy or regulations , but with their own transport we do n't have to bother about these things we travel when we want and when we have time .
We do n't have to book tickets in private transport .
So we can say that travelling in their own transportation is more comfortable .
People had drived car to go a work .
The city have a lot traffic .
They prefer to go work car than bus .
Public transport is very cheap then car and reduce traffic in the city .
It 's true drive by car is so much more convenient , because people do n't need to wait bus .
They can drive any hour , they can to go and to come any moment .
They can travel another place , independent the hour .
Bus , boat and train are public transport most used for people .
Some cities there are n't boat , because do n't have river or sea .
It 's comum in city the bus .
Some bus have special and preferencial sit to old people .
This is interesting because people are practice solidary .
I think could have a lot bus in city .
Many car is poluent for planet and is alergic to people .
The train do n't have poluition .
This transport is better to population and do n't have traffic in city .
Another idea is ride a bicycle and to walk street .
This can help heauthy the people and city will stay most clean .
So we must reduce by car on street .
We will be very happy and we .
will be more heauthy .
My favourite sports walk , I really like this sport for several reasons :
1- It 's very common I can do it anywhere and anytime I want .
2- It 's very cheap , I will not buy anything to do .
3- It 's not hard sport , in all cases I will not be tired after walking .
4- It makes me relax because I stop doing my activity from work and study .
5- It gives me big time to think on all my life without any distributions from anybody .
cause all these reasons walking is my favourite sport .
From few years , people use different types of transport . We ride by bus or by car .
We fly at plane or something other .
The travelling by car is more convenient in my opinion .
Firstly , you save money if you use a car .
When you ride by bus , you pay more .
Moreover you travel with the other people .
You stay in queue for buy a ticket .
Secondly , you should feel uncomfortable .
At some means of transport is too crowded and you haven ' t got a place to stay .
sometimes you lie on a window .
It is n't good .
Finally , if you ride a car you musnt care about timetable . You can go at every hour .
When you go by bus for example , you must wait at cold bus station .
I hate this .
At sum up , in my opinion travelling by car is better .
You have comfort , you feel better .
You do n't have to worry that you do n't arrive in time .
Unfortunately , is very sad to say that people in my town does not care about the environment .
We need to start doing something to avoid contamination .
There are so many little things we could do to care for the environment .
So many storms , and all the things happening around the world are the result of not taking care of the only planet we have to live .
I suppose their lifstile intolerable , resteless and I really sympothise with them Magotity of outstanding and appreciated people are frustrated .
They turn into arrogant and furious idols because of shortage of ptivate lifetime perpetual attention .
That is a pitiless trial for celebrities bit through thick and thin they go on .They archieve the goals made exceptionally in sake of money and vanity .
I realised it is not worth it .
Thank you for your care .
There is one thing confuse me that is the old extension number .
I always answer some wrong calls and these calls distract me .
I receive many calls looking for the previous worker and I need to spend my time to explain what happened to him .
May I have a new extension number ?
Thanks for your help .
Dear Jo ,
Romania is a beautiful country and has many jobs .
Also there are many places to see , mountains , lakes where you can relax and have fun .
The jobs are nice and you can work for three months .
There is good pay also .
I also work in summer as a waitress in a terrace .
It is good and people are nice .
See you soon .
Hi ,
I hope you are well .
I 'm writing you a letter because I was made a short film with my friends , and I want to tell you what is the film about and how was the experience .
The idea of make a film comes up a Saturday night at a meeting of friends .
At first we thought that the idea was just a joke , but Jake , one of my friends , said that he had carried a video camera .
When Jake said that , we start roar with laughter , but then , another friend offered the idea to do a home film .
The experience about the film was amazing , because we laugh all night and we enjoyed that very cool idea .
In itself , the film did n't have an especially topic , but I can describe it like friend 's film as appears lot of laughts , jokes , and it reflected that friendship is the greatest thing that exists .
By the way , I 'm sending the film together with this letter .
Let me know about you and your life .
Hope to hear from you soon ,
Bianca
Running is my therapy .
I started running to lose weight and ended in a life changing experience .
Some may say that running is very similar to religion , but to me is more than that .
Running connects me to my inner Goddess .
Running is cheap and everyone can take up running , no experience required after all it is just one step after the other .
In My country Bus 's car is the essential public transport .
So I got a lot troubles :
1 . Everyone spends much times to travel .
2 . Bus car 's driver does n't care people who around him .
That means he is a careless , who always drives too fast
But public transport has advantages : If we uses it is the essential transport to travel .
Therefore environment will be improved .
Maybe traffic 's accident is decreased
I am writing to report on the local transport of Toluca .
The public transport most used in Toluca is el bus because it is the most cheaper , but it is very bad and unsafe , the qualiti of it is very bad , the buses are old and obsolete these have broken windows and old and broken seats .
The service is very bad the drivers are very angry and stressed out these do not lead with cauition , in Toluca exist report of high rates of accidents by buses .
The public transport is unsafe because growth the theft and kidnapping express to users .
I suggest changing the old buses by new buses and put security cameras in the buses .
That the cameras transmitted immediately the image of the robbers at other buses to ensure that they are alert , and that the drivers receive training and sanctions by conduct bad .
I think we live very quick , always running , we do n't enjoy our lives .
Because we want a lot of money , a lot of things ... we are always working for giving more money , we do n't meet our neighbour for example .
Maybe in the future will be worse .
There is is no future for public transport because car has made life so easy .
It 's economically and practically is more expensive .
People
Prefer to use cars instead of public transport .
It 's saves time .
In old times luxuries were not considered as compare to Heslth but now every one prefer to save time and maintain privacy which one can only afford by using her / his private transport so gradually public transport losing its charm .
public transport
I think it 's very important as it reduce the problem of both pollution and population we use few transport as it is big and carry a lot of people .
underground , trains and buses these means of transport are cheap so it helps the poor to save some money .
governments should take care of public transport they should save means of entertainment peoples should keep them clean and safe if they use it carelessly it will be useless Now There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
cars are faster than public transport so cars are more convenient than public transport it is easier , faster and more comfortable especially in long distances so governments should improve public transport as not all people have cars
Now a day 's travelling became easier for the humans to move all over the world .
Many of the people habituated to use their own vehicle as their transport , where they can reach their destination in time .
In the following paragraphs , I present my view in this controversial issue .
firstly , We are having different modes of transport facilities , which among is road transport .
As Automotive Industries are huge in market , most of the house holders prefer to buy a car rather than any other motor vehicle .They can have easy move from source to destination with in no time .
And there need not to be depend on the public transport of their journey .
As private transport is increasing day by day , it 's surprises that there may not be any public transport in up coming days .
Secondly , if the private transportation is growing faster , the traffic is also going to create a major problem , which effects the global warming .
And the income that is getting through this servicing transport will automatically dropdown , which create a problem to the economy of the government .
Another issue we can see here is unemployment .
Most illiterate people choose their proficiency as public transportations like , bus service , cab service , auto service .... etc , in order to full fill their basic needs .
People with more unemployment may also lead to a crime rate .
I hope , giving equal priority for both public and private transportation makes healthy .
And we can see that controlling traffic is not going out of the hands .
In all times and places there is always some typical food of the country where we live .
My name is Laura and I live in Argentina .
Here , in this country there are typical dishes , desserts , drinks .
Some of them are , roast , mate and some others , but those are the best known .
On the one hand , I like to have things typical in each country , apart from they are delicious , because when you 've got the opportunity to travel , you can go and experience with the food too .
On the other hand , the bad thing about when there are so delicious food , it 's that always you want to eat some typical food of your country and at the end it 's very bad for the body because we eat them in excess .
In ten years , they did n't change that things , because they are delicious and no one would like to eat anything other than roast !
i think if the goverment do the best work about the transport , they can save it .
the public transport is the best way to save the planet and have a best atmosphere ; also we safe money and can meet people .
it is true the car is more confortable , but it uses a lot of mineral recurses like petrol wich can contaminate the ambient .
i do nt think the public transport does not have future , there are a lot of people who can not buy a car and has to use the communite transport .
Public transport is very much complicated now a days .
Place like Mumbai is full of People and no place to park the vehicles .
Day by day people are increasing in Mumbai .
Crowd is more and all the people want to travel by public transport so it is difficult to travel . Best way to travel in there
own car or van .
This will saved their time .
Transport are good way to travel from place to another place .
I had word with a boy and he will reply to me by tomorrow .
It will be good to interview both and you can decide .
I am hoping this boy will come for the interview as he was saying recently he has got a new job .
Is the Internet the greatest invention of all time ?
Internet is a useful means for everyone , so we are getting on with distant friend , and we look for important information when we are studying or entretainament themself .
First of all , I am going to talk about adavantages and disadvantages for this topic .
First adavantage , is Interent too much quick , for example when you want information about something .
Second advantage is Internet by website , such as twiter , facebook ... You allow speak with your quick friend , or you can meet ith them by website , therefore you do not call by telephone , so internet is too much cheap .
According to disadvantanges , at present , childs are aways playing with his computer games and mobile phone .
Both computer game and mobilephone have got internet , as a result , they have not got time the another traditional games .
Other disadvantages is that , people do not meet with friends , since they speak by website Internet , so every time there is unless relationship , the people is not sociable .
To sum up Internet is an progress more important in the world , but too there are a lot disadavantages and advantages .
In my point of view , Internet is useful for everyone , but we should not abuse , so carring out another activities .
Good Thriller was not my favorite type of gender until I saw ' No Escape ' .
This movie is about what happens in the real life right now , on the other side of the world .
They persecute an American family that went because of the dad 's job , which was something about a company that the natives from that place hated most .
Without expecting it at all , this family went somewhere over Asia to start a new way of living .
In other words , they had to get use to a different kind of world .
It was n't that easy for the couple with two little girls .
They had to escape with the doors from the country closed , while making sure both girls did n't get their minds full of junk ( people killing ) .
And in some of the scenes the little girl escaped or the dad had to make them jump from a building to another one !
Anyways , I would n't want to ruin the ending but I would definitely recommend you to see what happens next !
Helen , I did n't expect this .
It was a huge surprise for me !
I really appreciate your card that you sent me .
It made me speechless !
I have never got anything like this .

Dear Principal of the Effective Learning School
I am interested in your advertisement you post in an English language magazine .
Recently I have got a job offer from a company located in London and it requires me ILETs score 6.5 for visa .
I have studied this exam not at all and I have got a very limited time , around 3months , before the last test so I would like to begin as soon as possible .
I am working daytime so night time , 6 pm to 9 pm , or anytime on weekends would be good for me except on Mondays and Wednesdays when I play basketball as a hobby .
Also I am thinking of studying with you for 2months but we can talk more about this later .
I am good at speaking and listening sections but not confident at writing , especially essay I 've never learnt in my life so I want to focus on this writhing part more than others .
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon .

Travelling by car is much more convenient but all know really there is no future for public transport .
When we talk about public transport , there are many people and everyone travel but i think we do not feel relax are there and if we talk about travelling by car .
It is the best or much more convenient for us .
Because we can travel any where but in public transport we can not travel to any other sites
I think there is a big future for public transport , because a lot of people want to take that and more than anything else that is convenience .
Especially some people do n't have a car and some elderly persons difficult to driving a car by themselves , so the public transport helpeing them a lot .
Already public transport have been improvement and that makes comfortable to go on a trip , but I think that will be able to become good quality more and more , because so many people expectation .
I like a car as well , but when I have to driving a car I have to think about parking a lot and I ca n't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am having travel , so the public transport is making connection with human beings .
It is why I think public transport is really important for public and there are a lot of important thing is having a possble in the future .
Every Human has points of strength and weakness .
So , the Humans including women and men should behave according to these points .
The question which is rising now should the employer hire women in some posts and excludes them from another , and so that for men .
There are two answer to this question , the first one is to who sees that it is right to exclude women from some jobs .
For example , the builder needs physical strength to carry cements and bricks .
The mechanic should have the ability to afford drawbacks of the job .
The second answer is it is not correct to exclude men or women from any posts .
The explanation of those who support the second answer is every one had borne equal in duties and rights .
So there is no one can hire someone or give anyone a job according to gender .
Is convenient take a year off between leaving school and starting the university ?
I think it is not necessary and not recommendable because you have the possibility to earn money and is difficult once you get used to earn money , you want to study again .
Also , if you want to travel , you have to make money for that and then , travel .
Furthermore you do n't study during this period and when you want to start the university you would n't be able to remember some important things
So , if you take a year off , you have to think about it .
People use public transport because of saving money .
But now they are earning more money than they earned before .
Therefore , it is likely to imminent that public transport will no longer exist in future .
think has a future that all people use public transport then I think that maybe continue to have future but has bad and good things , for example good is easier to move in the city and you save time , and the bad , bad people attack you and steal things , but I thing , that have future , because a lot people even they use public transport to .
the people use the public transport also the people needs to move for all the city .
what I ' m saying is that if you have future public transport that people use so much that you will have future
Convenience is not the only one consideration when we are travelling .
A lot of people choice public transport for travelling because it 's cheaper , easier , more relaxed and sometimes faster than driving a car .
In recent years , governments encourage people to take public transport because of fuel crisis .
Some of governments invest much money to construct public transport network to make travelling by public transport more convenient .
When driving a car , we will face a parking space trouble in a city .
Besides , a traffic jam is another problem .
So , I do n't think there is no future for public transport .
My mother is my inky best friends in my family , she always listening to me , sometimes i call her with her real name!.
She always tell me some jokes but some times i laughed !
, i love her so much , i do n't know how will my world being like without her and i wo n't to know .
I pray everyday to save my mother and all my family to me .
My name is Tom , I 'm 12 years old .
I have a black skin , black hair .
I 'm short .
I am wearing a shirt , and a pair of trousers .
I will wait for you at the train station
Well , there 're a lot of sport that people practise every day but I have one which is my favourite .
It 's basketball .
This sport have a lot of type of match which you can play .
You can play with your friends or in a team even alone but this option is the most boring .
Basketball is a perfect sport because you can develop your reflections and your ships with people .
I enjoy playing basketball because I relax when I play it and I can meet new people and travel around your city or your country . That it 's the best because you can visit the cities ...
And you enjoy between your mates and live all those special moments with them .
I can give you some advice to start practising this sport .
This 's a sport that improve your friendships and it 's so good for your health .
And maybe you became a famous player or a simple player but you feel like a famuos .
But it is important to enjoy yourself .
The old house on the hill is a landmark in my city .
At the beginning of its history , my city was a big farm .
A river passes by the city and , occasionally , there were floods on the place .
Tired of having their house destroyed , the landlords decided to build a new house on the hill , so they would n't be molested by floods anymore .
There is a tale that mentions a treasure hidden on the house .
This treasure was used to finance a civil war that took place in the south of the country .
After the war , the gold has been left in the house .
People came and destroyed the house looking for the big treasure .
I absolutely disagree with this statement .
There are 7 billion people in the world , and it is increasing rapidly .
How many car for all of people in the world ?
Have you ever driven on the crowded city and moved with 1 km/h .
More people use public transport , less car on the road , you can walk and enjoy the city .
Besides , it 's also an environment problem , exhaust fumes engulfed the earth , more car is used , more exhaust gas release , we are killing our mother .
In addition , those who live on below average incomes do not have money to buy car .
Automobile is luxury in some country , like mine .
It 's the way to prove you wealthy , when you get a car to your home , or go to school , work by a car , people will change their mind about you .
Public transport is being become a must - have mean with many people who have low - income .
In conclusion , Public transport is our future means , I mean for almost citizen .
Not car though it 's convenient .
my favourite sport is swimming , it makes me feeling comfortable and left me in a good mood , i go to swim twice a week , and my advice to anyone want to start to enjoy every moment of it
I have read an article on IFLS talks about a sheep has human face .
It shows in the video that the sheep actually has big nose and lips just like human .
Which is one of the weirdest thing I have seen .
They say the reason why he has a human face is the farmer gave his mom an extra dose of Vitamin A. As a result , that causes the deform in his face .
In my opinion , I think it is just coincidence that the sheep looks like human .
On the other hand , the farmer who owns the sheep refused to sell the sheep for higher price than normal to the circus .
I think the sheep should be transfer to a place where is specialty in animal with same condition .
life is a long journey .everday , we gain more & more experience .
we bocome not only older but also wiser .we learn but the most useful thing to learn is to get in alot of experiences & for sure to make mistakes .but we have to be honest with our selves by admitting our mistakes to avoid them in the future .
I am in Kyoto to eat Yatsuhashi .
I have seen Momiji .
It is very beautiful .
Becsuse there is turening red !
I have never seen this view .

Dear Sir Stuart Thomson ,

Yours Sincerely

Nowadays technolgy is more modern than in the past and people always developing their invention to become more useful .
We as a human who live in these days , we live rely on technolgy , every aspect of our live are supporting by technolgy .
And because of technolgy our lofe become easier .
One of the example is television , in the past we use it only for watching news and movie , but as the time goes and the technolgy is developing t , now television has others function .
Television can be used tor many things , usually we watch television for entertaining , but we can also use it for education too .
These are the proofs that television can also educate .
First , television has many programs which are can be used for education .
Many programs consist lessons for kids to learn , for kids who still want to learn speaking and know the words , it is very useful because many programs are very suitable for their to help them learn faster by watching television .
Besides that we can also use television to make us become knowledgeable , by watching news programs .
Second , tthese days television become modern and it make television can connected with internet .
By that advantage , now we can easily search and get information from the internet by using television .
We can search it on browsing or we can also access youtube to help us .
So we can watching a program that we wanted so we can choose what is good and not .
In conclusion , televeision can entertain and also educate because television programs make it in interesting way .
I will talk about my favourite sport .
My favourite sport is football I enjoy playing football with my friends we play at night it was very excited to play when the sky was rain .
When anyone miss to pass the ball or miss scored a goal we shouting on his face are you crazy how you missed this goal !
But we were too interested .
We enjoy watching football match
my favourite sport is football .
I 'm not good at playing it , if I prefer to play volleyball , but I like to watch the games .
The emotions the only try if you 're a fan of any team , and you know the happiness that you feel when it wins , it 's indescribable .
Footbal is usually a sport that appeals primarily to males , but I 'm a girl that sometimes I realize that I know more than some males .
I started following football in 2007 , just 10 years old , I started because I fell in love with a team that then led me to love football in general .
I like to watch the games at home with my father , but mostly always go to the stadium with my dad , you feel indescribable emotions . and my father was to convey this passion .
The future for the public transport should n't be taken lightly , in my opinion , the public transport is the best option for ending the problems with the traffic jam because when we use a bus or subway , a lot of people is travelling from one place at other in only one transport or vehicle .
For many years the public transport had allowed that the people travel a long distance for work that otherwise would not be possible .
Better still the future of the public transport is essential for a better life without traffic .
When we used the car , for general , one person is the unique who is accustomed to using your own car , so not is exploiting the potential of this car .
At the time , we need more cars for more people , that 's the meaning for more traffic .
it 's for this reason that I think the public transport is a great benefit for the society , and a good way for move us of the one place at other , I suggest that the government has to give more means for the purpose of improving the public transport .
Hi freddy ,
I have recived your letter .
I apologise to you for not writing sooner , but I 've been really busy lately .
Your party sounds extremely enjoyable .
Here , parties are normally for family and friends .

I 'm afraid I 'm not quite with you , even approve public transport will get more in the future .
You ca n't disagree our global become urbanization in the future , can you ?
That become our life more and more crowd
Today 's television !
Once you have in mind by inviting others to get home and watch TV is what people expected !
The big deal is entertaining , and quality is part of it .
Keep it in mine what you should do before buying your own dreaming TV .
You should consider that large and being untouchable TV is what you must find in one .
However people nowadays look for a good design and not for quality , the big problem is that prize is against quality , even though a good designing of TV series on well known stores is the big option that we can choose to check .
Consider a good prize and good quality by checking and visiting stores , you should not spend too much money by buying the biggest TV or largest , you can save money by only watching few minutes on stores , have your sit , enjoy and list if you are convinced .
In conclusion , enjoy watching movies in your own TV considering prizes and qualities , some TV brings you the experience to enjoy your favourite movies in other scenery , will you try ?
People who reach 18 have to complete military service is an issue , the supporters suggest that is helpful for the 18 to train the physical fitness and psychological quality , whilst opponents point out that is harmful for the human right and affect development of the country .
Consider both aspects that can be concluded that government should respect the human right and set up a new department which use for people who want to apply to complete the military service .
In my opinion our lives will have a dramatic change in the next 50 years .
You just have to think that 50 years ago we did n't know what a smartphone or a laptop was , in the schools we used book of paper and not tablet or iPad , and now technology is part of our lives .
I think and hope that maybe in 50 years scientists will find a cure for many disease and that would change our life because we could live for more time .

I agree with statement that Mark Twain is the greastest American writer .
His works are known by all over the world .
When I read his poem " The adventure of Tom Soyer " I was exited .
The last thriller I have watched is " True Detective " from HBO .
That is eight - episodes film .
First of all I would like to tell about atmosphere of the film .
That is like you are going down down stairs to dark room and feeling curiosity and fear at the same time .
I was impressed because I ' ve never seen before such films .
That slow - motion action is so impressive that I have been seen that only for one day .
Particulary I would like to point Mathew McConnahy 's role .
Philosophy of his hero is so much diffrent we used to think everyday that I have taken a look on my life from another point of view .
Last time I was so impressed from watching " Fight Club " of David Fincher .
I really recommend that movie to watch .

This report is aiming to give a clear idea about the environment preserving in my town .
First of all , the local council organised a competition promoting ecological awareness and encouraging the local community to preserve the community .
Second , New rules were legislated condemning any person intended to harm the environment in any way .
Third , supporting the recycling by inventing three types of rubbish bins for hard wastes , for liquids and the third for clothes .
I am a big fan of Arsenal .
so it comes as no surprise my favourite sport is football .
football is considered to be the most watched and followed sport worldwide .
I would like to look to this sport from different perspectives .
Firstly , football plays a vital role in unifying people locally and internationally , for example it helps US and China to normalize their relations .
secondly , football generates money .
Thirdly , from aesthetic point of view , it was call the beautiful game by Pele .
although I have been playing football for years , I am still not a professional player , this may be because I am not talented .

The diagrams show how bank notes are made .
Firstly , design the bank notes ' backgroud colour it is artwork security issues .
Second preparation metal plates .
It 's skilled machinists .
Then the sheets of bank notes printd .Printing colour on both sides and sprcial ink or images slightly raised .
When printing finished , they should inspection .
It the most important step .
Printed sheets manually inspected .
Finally , they found good quality sheets and some partially damaged sheeets or bad sheets .
They will packaging and distribution the sheets which is good in there .
In that time they at fist cut into separate bank notes , second they packed the sheets and diapatched .
At the same timebad sheets and bank notes securely destoryed .
Why not?.Firstly , what 's for you education?,It 's very clear for me that education is to create the conditions to do your thinkings grow .
If the way to do that it 's easy and nice I think at the end is better than explain theory concepts .
Other reason for my opinión is that almost all the people preffer use the visual sense and ear to other person more than write and listen for understand new things .
while we are spendind good time watching TV our brain is not in calm , only in an other position different to that ones in the rest od the day .
That 's why I think that it 's a good momento to see the thing through a new glass and that can be a very high opportunity .
Deffinitly , No alwyas , It depend on the kind of programme , but I Think that nowdyas a lot of televisión ofert help to the people develop more effectively .
Hunting is the funniest thing I know . I like to hunt because it is so peaceful to come out in the forest .
I start to hunt when I was seven years old .

I hunt most with my dad , and we always have really fun when we hunt but sometimes we can be a bit angry on each other .
Me and my dad have three dogs and we hunt moose , rabbit and roe deer with them .
Their name is Pluto , Krocken and Zelda .
When I 'm with my stepdad and hunt we have very fun because we live in a cabin and it 's a really funny man to I laugh every evening and have very fun .
They 've got many mosses so they shoot very much of them , and they shoot at least every time I am there .

However , one of dreams is keeping in my heart that I ca n't forget it forever .
One night , as usual , I slept .
In a flash , I rolled down from a mountain and I did n't know where I was .
It just a very long tunnel where was dark and strange , After , I felt my body ache .
I began to yell that hoped someone could save me to leave from here .
Fifty minutes passed , when my body no longer was sore .
I decided to walk to the end .
Constantly , I just walked like without terminal contest .
While I strugged to walk .
Finally , I saw a light to appeare my eyes and I woke up .
Seeing same light appeared my eyes .
It lets me feel that it 's a strange dream .
Nowadays we see an enormous improvement of infrastructure .
Nevertheless travel by car is easier for commute for example , because they can choose a personal timetable without a terrible discomfort of buses ; in addiction there is a fair chance that by the end of this century dwellers will stop travelling by public transport , in special way if the government have invested his money in green energy and we could discover a new green car , which in turn revolutionary our life .
Well , the form that we use the television depend one each on .
Will has people that use the television as fun , most of the time ; but has too their people that use television for searchs .
For example , the chanel '' Animal Planet '' has a lot of informations of animals and how it lives .
In my opinion the people use television for distraction .
When we come after the job , or school , we need a form to relax .
Maybe studies we make otherwise ; in search on computers , in books , etc ...
The television 's use is staying more and more utilized by the people ; so we are getting more problems of vision .
It looks like a kind of addiction ... We need to use the technology on our behalf .
The capitalist 's world make us increasingly become us updated .
So we have to watch the national Journal for keep us connected .
Now a days everybody have conditions to buy a television , so the numbers of the tv viwers get up ; even being poor or rich ; most can watch a movie , or a documentary .
There are no apologizes to be a informed person .
To go shopping , is one of these things that you can love or , like it happen to me , you can hate at all .
Normally , I 'm not spending a lot of time on going shopping , even when I really need something .
In general , I find it very boring and stressed .
If I must do it , my favourite way of shop is the high street of my town , or in another town or country .
These shopping centres , full of people and noise , are crazy !
Shopping online is neither , from my experience , a good way of shop .
In my case , I 'm always wrong with the sizes and to return the products , takes me a long time and a great effort , so it does n't worth it .
Much better is to take a walk in the high street , and make from this time something for pleasure .
Socializing online help us to contact with our friends by easy way in different places and this way cost us money .
Socializing person does not cost us money , but we need one place to contact each other .
Finally , we enjoy in both ways in our life .
For the last years , the public transport has been forget .
Now , public transport is not the future , because travelling by car is much more convenient .
The people who do n't use the public transport , think that travelling by car is much better .
But they do n't know the big problem with the pollution .
I think .
If everybody uses the public transport , the world be much better . and the people will be stress less , because they will be not worried about parking places or be in the traffic .
Maybe it will be a really good opportunity for the people , being more healthy too .
Compared with local bookstores , publishers or media such as newspapers considering the Internet market , public transportation has much better future .
There are two reasons .
The first reason is that public transportation carries humans .
Humans are the most sensitive luggage .
You have to take vary much cares when you carry humans .
Even though people trying to develop drones to reduce logistic costs , it is difficult to apply the technology to carry humans .
The second reason is automatic driving technology needs some more time for the development .
Also , the automatic driving technology is already applied for trains .
The running costs will be decreased .
We are going on a vacation Next week .
We prefer to Take A Flight To Hawaii .
We love to travel there and here , but this is the place I wish to go long time ago .
I hope it would be fun there .and thinking about the beautiful scenery makes me felt that I must go while I can .I ca n't wait till the day comes

My favorite sport is swimming .
it 's because swimming is really fun .
Also I think swimming can keep your body fit and it can make the swimmer cool down when it is in a summy day .
The advice that I give to someone who want to start swimming .
It is not be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn swimming and also when the age become older it will be more difficult to learn than the little .
So these are the advice that i give for them .
English - I find it greating !
I like learning English .
It 's my passion .
I like talking to friends and I can communicate with other people .
I ca n't pronunciate well .
I do n't know the stress of words is where .
it 's so difficult .
So bored when I ca n't continue learn English .
Michael was alittle boy he was 10 years old he went with his parents to his grandfather 's home .
The home was on a shore.there was a tunnel but it 's hole is in the deep.first he used to be polite and obay the other orders .
Once a day he met a girl called sarah she was 9 years old inspite of michael was bigger but sarah could control him.every day they went to the sea playing and swimming until the sun set .once a day sarah made a challange with michael about who can enter the tunnel from the hole in the sea and get out from the other hole on the shore but michael was afraid .he was telling himself which animals could be there or is there were air there but he has no choice so he accepted the challange .sarah told him she will go first.she took a breath ... deep one and started to dive .
Micheal was afraid he was waiting for sara to get out he went to the shore to look if she went from the other side but he found no footprints.his mother called him he went home and still thinking about sarah.it was night and ge was afraid ti get there again.he went to sleep .michael closed the door and knew at this moment he had made a mistake .
An clean or healthy environment is always acceptable to all kinds people .
Our city is quite clean and livable , people are more careful than before .
They are sincerely manage wastage and avoid carbon generated products .
Also obedient to the rules and regulation of the city authority .
Initially , Waste management system of our locality is comparatively effective than before .
Our authority now follow the scientific method for rubbish control ; recycle , reuse , galvanization .
As a result , the city dwellers are now enjoying more healthy environment .
It is a more expected criteria , why the authority step up many organization working for waste management .
Due to our helpful people is works become easier .
Most of the cases , not only my family members but also our neighbor like to avoid carbon level increasing products those are responsible for temperature increase .
Many organizations work for making up the consciousness of the pupil , so people are more sensitive about the environmental pollution .
Now government is working for decreasing smoke emission of the mill and industry .
Scientists and researcher jointly work for carbon emission lessening .
Some advancement happened already , it 's implementation also runs with full speed .
Last but nor least , the strict rules and regulation have more effective impact on to make a good town .
Our authority is more careful about the rules and regulation ; hence no - one can eschew the rules .
The job announcement on your webpage immediately took my attention , as it has always been my dream to work for the German - Norwegian Youth Forum and the requirements meet just the skills that I can provide you with .
The first time I took part in the youth forum was in 2012 and since then it has been a big part of my life .
Influenced by it I started to look for universities in Scandinavia .
Since 2013 I am studying English and Marketingscommunications at University College Syddanmark .
It is well accepted that shopping is not always enjoyable , and following is my reasons .
Firstly , shopping can waste you so much time .
You may not realize when you shopping happily .
But you may find that when you notice you have many things still need to finish .
Secondly , shopping can make you upset because of something you can not afford .
You may come across something , such as luxury bags , but you can not buy it because of the tight budget .
Furthermore , even you just buy something you can afford , you may also waste much more money .
So , based on what I have written , I think shopping is not always very happy . We can find something much happier than shopping easily .
My favourite sport is cricket . I love cricket very much since from my school time .
cricket is a game of bat and ball in which there are two teams which have eleven players on each side .
generally we are using criket ground as a oval shape .
Travelling by car is certainly much more convenient than travelling by tram or trolley bus , which only follow the lines of their routes .
But thinking about the environment , traffic jams and sometimes absence of parking places makes me changing the statement .
On one hand you put all your things in the car and drive anywhere you want to , on the other hand if you feel not very well to drive , you have no money to buy a car or the downtown of your city is closed for all the means of transport except for the public ones : tram , bus or trolley bus is your wayout .
HOW YOU CAN THE BEST LOOK AFTER YOUR ENVIRONMENT ?
Good question about item , how can answer , if you would win £ 100 .
I have a few easy recepts , how you can be a well off £ 100 and how you can help the environment .
Firstly , I describe how I can help my local environment and what I do useful for item .
I am a very stricte keen ecology person for 10 years .
I am interesting about natural ways how we could help in the local area .
I am a serious fan of environment .
I describe how it looking my every day .
I tend to drive with my bicycle from home to work , I do n't used my car or buses for long time , because is not healhty and costs .
A bicycle is for me the best way how we can be do fit and a good condition and also to more less polution without cars .
Secondly , I save water and electricity , because costs are quit expensive .
So , my bills from water are inexpensive , because I swap to have a bath than take a shower .
Next point is an issue , that if I am not at home I do switch off the temperature .
I switch on a home hiting for a temporary time , when I am working off I used more energy to warmht at home .
Next point is a fact , that recycle glass and paper is most important .
I tend to collect in three different boxes of waste , for paper , second for glas and plastic and third for rest rubbish .
It 's a very domestic and a huge issue for us life .
We learn to really segreation of waste and in the future how e.g.:we could use second time a same glass .
Finally , we are obligatory to care about the environment , because it 's us duty .
I think it is true , because o lot of people like travelling by car .
But there are some problems like these - how will drive a lot of people who do n't like to drive or ca nt drive because he has some problems with the health .
Anyway , a lot of people will need some transport in some cases not privat , but public , and we ca nt say that this kind of transport willl not be useful .
May be , in small part
Some years ago when the weather was colder here people had eaten more meat with wine .In fact growing vegetables was not possible because of the weather .
In fact today people interested in drinking wine during participating at parties or meeting with friends .
There are various opinions about how foods plays essential role in our lifestyle .
Potatoes and meat are popular food between our people .
Although healthy diet is quite expensive young people follow special diet in order to have better body shape or healthy life .
Actually modern life affected on our palate changing .Instance some people who work majority of their waking houres prefer to use fast food more .
Our commitments imposes us to forget ourselves and our healthy .
It may be cause increasing wight or reducing the number of necessary vitamines which our body needs .
In my view the reason of having more energy during the day lies in the diet program which is followed by each of us .
In conclution if we have decision to living long following suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable .
The members of my family is no where near my best friends .
You see , I do not see members of ones family ones best friends because personally I did n't and still do n't have a great relationship with anyone in my biological family .
And this may have effected my way of thinking and acting in different situations .
So no , my members in my biological family is n't my best friends .
Dear Sir ,
Thank you for giving me the chance to transfere the information as per your request .
For my town , there are many regulations that are forced by the municipality and environment ministry , such as preventing animals like ( sheeps , horses , cows .. etc ) , from being in the town and in the population areas .
Besides , due to the critical situation we are living and facing in iraq .
As we are fully depending on the indivitual generators , that are causing multiple problems in he weather dueto it 's smoke , the oil and gass left behind , in addition to sound offcourse that are themain source for the 18 countinous hours noise .
people , espicially grnerator 's owner , start using Canaopies , using very long pipes to get rid off as possible as they can from the polution .
Other resedential areas , using their potentialsto maintain the environment by planting trees , roses , having nemourse green spaces .
Also recycling the trushes are a very inteligent way to keep the town clean , and get multiple use of the products in industry lines .
on the Otherhand , eldest people in our city having many socity responsiblties that are encourging the youngest ages to participate in the annual gardening festival , for the indoor and outdoor gardens .
Finally , we always believe that one hand can not clap .
Although , each house can make a real difference by taking good care of the infront area and keeping it clean .
Hope that those information are of good use .
Regards .
Michael and Marcuangolo were friends but in the school they were enemies .They had amazing battles in the playground .
One day at the end of the classes , Marcuangolo wanted to hit him , and Michael ran away .
Michael stopped and hit his enemy .
Marcuangolo fell in the street .
A car crashed and Marcuangolo started bleeding .
Michael took his enemy to the hospital .
There was a doctor at the emergency room and Michael explained the problem to him .
The doctor was angry and Michael cried .
They brought Marcuangolo to a room and put the boy in a bed .
The doctor ask for his phone number and he phoned his parents .
Michael understood that he must take away .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
As soon as I came on university , my life changed .
Before I entered university , life in high school had n't a lot of friends and I was so lonely but after I started to study at Ton Duc Thang university , I became more happy , comfortable and interactive .
In my class , I have a group of close friends , and they treated me very well .
I'll have a friend at university because I scared strangers .
The first day when I studied at the university , I had a lot of friends .
we sit around together and talk about where they live .
At the weekend , I like going for a walk and get some fresh air with my friend .
We laughed and eating together .
I was very happy at the time , and I have the friend sincerely .
I expect we 'll be the best friends forever .
it was a wonderful experience with me
I was walking to football training session with my friend Michal last week .
It was raining and it was dark .
The weather was horrible .
We were talking about the last match , we were discussing our faults , when suddenly we heard a loud noise .
It turned out that a bus hit a lorry just in front of us .
The people were screaming .
Some passengers were hurt and weak .
I ran to help them and also we called the ambulance .
The police came after 5 minutes and the ambulance too .
It was a scary situation .
We were shocked !
Hi Isabel
I am living in Deria which is located in Dubai .
It is small and quite city .
I like the Indian resturants in the city , in addition infrastructure and roads are well orgnaise .
obeying to the statement above , it 's necessary to say that is a very interesting topic , because it 's quite related to actual problems , such as problems in the environment .
This is to say that most part of cars are not green , namely , current cars are not designed for generate a good impact in the environment .
Regarding the reason for the described situation is due to the strong economic interests of oil companies which are intended to get as much money as possible , regardless of the damage that they are causing to species of plants and animals .
Thus , the question is , travelling by car is so much more convenient for whom ?
For multinational maybe ?
Or for some consumers that can afford a toxic and expensive car ?
, even though , when the public transport gets so crowded , is less harmful indeed , in terms of the impact received by the environment , because it means more individuals in the same place , meanwhile each new car means increasingly pollute .
Travelling by would be more convenient with a good conscience of protect the planet .
The idea of banned cars from the centre of all major cities have advantages and disadvantages .
The good things about not allow cars in the cities centres are that the traffic will be reduced , the trips will be faster and the contamination will be less .
On the other hand the bad things are that you have to park out of the city centre and these areas will be crowded , you could n't visit places with your car and people with physical problems could have difficulties with public transport .
In my opinion it is a good idea , but perhaps the restriction could have exceptions for certain people and certain days and hours , or if you need to visit a particular place with your car you could ask for a special permission .
The village I live , there is a lot of vegetation for that reason we try to protect environment , some of the things we do is to give mantainance every week to the vagetation zone checking if there is any garbage , to avoid this we teach the younger 's enviromentalist actions so they do n't throw cans , paper , or , candies to the floor they also can help the older people , there are cases which a person throws garbage to the street's , floor or to the vegetation to avoid that happening again we have a punishment that is to pay some money if the do n't they wo nt be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again , unless they were visitors , in that case we told him or her the way we live in the village and , we give him or her advises to keep a beautiful place without garbage .
More environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by takeng care of themthere is to that we have a center of care and , other more institutions , we also make environmental protection centers were people can visit and learn about this to sum up our village is very concentrated on taking care of the natural world that sorrounds us

In my opinion public transportation is most convenient way to travelling . The air pollution is a one reason that I prefer public transportation .
On the other hand it is very economic than owne car .
Whatever you can save the time and go any where more quickly by public transport .
Nowdays , in school we learn a lot of subjects , which we less or more use in our lives , some of them are really important , but some of them are just wasting of time .
On the one hand , we had n't to range subjects by their

Public transport is not convenient for most of the people because every person wants to reach on time at his place but using public transport it is very difficult to reach on time .
FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY 'S
all begins in 1981 when freddy fazbear 's pizza open , the establishment it 's a pizza restaurant but this pizza restaurant in had robots , in 1981 there were four animatronics and their names are Chica , Foxy , Bonnie and Freddy .
Three robots in specific hour make a show with instruments like a band .
Foxy the pirate makes a show individually in her pirate cove , The children loves Foxy because plays with the kids making questions about the pirates and count a pirate story .
When freddy begin to sings the kids screams and they sing with Freddy the famous Freddy Fazbear 's Song , Bonny plays the battery and Chica serves the pizza to the children , This year the stablishment close because they found the body of a dead child .
In 1983 The pizza restaurant reopened with more security and robots with more friendly appearance .
The establishment seek a security guard who had to keep the pizza restaurant at night , I am the security man .
When I saw the advertisement about the job in this moment I think that is very easy , I called the number , they give me the information and I accept .
The rules are simple just see the laptop , watch the animatronics , wait to 6:00am and close the doors if you needed I say OK .
My first night was easy because only see the screen and pass the camera to camera and nothing strange happened , I could only hear footsteps and noises .
My second and third night they were very strange because in the cameras the animatronics move as if it wanted to get to my room and do something to me .
The fourth and fifth night were the worst because the animatronics were very active , closed it and opened the doors because they try to get into my room .
but I could survive the night .
After tonight remove me the place and never went back to Freddy 's Pizza

Hi friend ,
In this holiday I go to Barcelona with my girlfriend .
It is an amazing city , it is really enjoy .
You can see monuments , theatres , beaches and different shops .
It is the most European city of Spain .
Rosetta becomes first spacecraft to orbit .
After a long flight , it reaches the orbit that is very long way far out of the solar system .
NASA replied as a very amazing achievement that Rosetta reaches out of solar system .
This may become a have leap after Armstrong landed on the Moon .
NASA replied that Rosetta will keep on its journey on travelling across the Universe .
Travelling by car becomes a comfortable factor nowadays because we can stop and go whenever we want , we can start at our desired timings .
This would gradually kill public transport .
One more reason is that banks provides loan at a lower interest which makes people to buy one to improve their comfort level .
People 's lives will not change if they do n't change themselves .Everyone want to improve his life to be better but how without doing anything . we must to start with education and healthy which are most important things to be better .
everyone need to focus not only his education but also on others .
To learn , to read , to be knowledge .
We need to focus on our inner skills and improve it .
No progress will happen without plan .Each one has a dream want to achieve it but first of all he need to put a plan and also cognitive one .
Our great example in changing is German .
after the second world war the improved themselves in 50 years and became one of the most developed countries .
In my city is very usual to find many dog 's shits in the road .
Is a big problem and it is almost a miracle not stepping one .
The solution I think would be to fine to owners .
I think that not is a problem of awareness .
I think the people know that his dogs litter the city but they prefer not to do nothing .
It is easier and more comfortable .
If they would had to pay then they would do .
In general the city looks clean .
The cleaning services work well .
Normally in the night .
In the hall tow care about city Center .
There are plants everywhere .
Madrid has many parks and many trees .
These also can be a problem because recently they are falling because they are older .
The hall tow has created a group that works studying the tree 's age to prevent further falls
We should must proper planing for our city to proper look after of it .
Actually , there are many huge problems are in your city just as there are no any proper drainage system for it not any specific canal system through which we can properly cleaned our city .
There , is another issue that is due to huge transport but little bit road they are not wide enough so that most of people are distributed due to these issues .

I was born 2001 in august the 10th in Danderyd .
I have two little brothers , Gus and Soren .
I have always lived in Danderyd .
My favorite sports/ hobbies is windsurfing and sailing .
The best place i ever have been on is an island in the east archipelago in Sweden .
Its not much trees there and a lot of high mountains .
There is much that i 'm proud of in my life but actually i do n't know what i 'm most proud of .
A very big weakness i have is that i can forget nearly everything especially homework and other school stuff .
Three words that describe me really good is :
happy funny and sometimes bothersome
A thing that i would like that people knew is that its not a good idea that wake me when i m sleeping .
I do n't actually know .
some day i want to go to Bali because it 's seems like a really nice place .
three things that i could do with is a bike , to be sick and bad computers .
my favorite movie is the wolf of wall street .
i do n't have a favorite book .
my favorite song is prayer in C
my favorite singer is AVICII
Simpsons or family guy .
my favorite food is fillet beef with bea and pommes .
my favorite restaurant is TGI fridays .

If you have a car you would probably think that travelling by car is better than by bus , but there are a lot of people who does n't have a car so they are used to go by bus and for them this way of travelling has become more conveniet because they have done it since they were children .
Then whatever the opinion you get is the result of the social situation in what you live .
Most people say that using public transport is better than using cars , and they say that its cheaper and better for the environment , about me I think that cars is easier and affordable way to transport between places , because cars is here any time and so near to your home instead of public transportation which you should take a walk to reach it in most countries , and also cars available all the time , you can go at 4 am and no one say anything , because its yours , but most public transportation is available only for the day hours and few hours at night , in emergency situation for example , what you will do , if you do not have your own car , your kid is sick , or you wife or your old parents , and in general the more we depend on ourselves the more our government able to help the poverty and homeless people out there , who really need more help and aid from the public community , we merely ask the government to improve streets and the traffic light systems , and more oil stations and parking in the streets , to be able to drive and move easy and safe and in a short time .
Everyone use public transport every day .
It is difficult to imagine how we can live without it .
But in spite of this a lot of people have a dream about a car .
The most said that using a car more convenient than using a public transport .
Of course private transport has a lot of advantages like : you do n't need to wait for a bus at the stopes or you can go every where you want in the time convenient for you .
Dear Alex ,
Long time no see .
How are you ? You know , it has been a long time since we have met each other why do n't we go to the cinema .
We are going to find a romantic movie or fiction movie .
So what time will you finish session ?
I will wait for you in the gate cinema .
Please respond at your earliest convenience ,
Best ,
Phuong .
27-dresses is a romantic comic and funny film , it is recommended for all ages .
I saw it with my family , my children and my husband , we had a good afternoon .
The film is based on a girl , she is invited to many weddings in which she is a maid of honor in all of them .
She has twuenty seven dresses of maid of honor , meantime , she call in love with a boy who is very handson , but he is working in a magazine and he has written about weddings in the city , he is a good writer , and she unknowns that .
The plot is well constructed , since the beginning becomes quite gripping .
The main characters , the actors are very younger and enjoyable .
This history develors a mixture of themes that courage , family values , friendly and love .
In conclusion , if you want to have a good time , you shoudl go to the cinema to see this film with your family , because it is an interesting and emotional film .
Nowadays we have a lot of environmental problems .
Transport polution is one of the most dangerous .
Almost every family have more than one car .
As a result roads are overloaded and long kilometres traffic jumps damage open air .
On the one hand that quantuty of cars ca n't be forbidden , because it 's personal right to have it or not .
On the other hand the government should think about some measures for protecting environment .
For example inventing severals special dates in a year for using only public transport .
Also improving measure might be as an encreasing green areas in cities and towns .
Rivers and seas are in danger too .
Unfortunately many tourists do n't take care about saving personal spaces ( on the river bank or on the sea beach ) in clean .
Factories damage nearest areas and water extremaly bad .
In my opinion , firstly , new bilding on the banks must forbidden at all .
Secondly , rules for tourists about caring environment must be very strick .
I think , nature'll get the most important benefits if everybody takes care about own space in the best way .
When it comes to health , it does cover physical and mental status too .
Sports is a unique way by which a person can maintain his or her health including both aspects that are physical and mental .
My favorite sport is Hockey .
The different formats of cricket allow me to maintain my health based on time available after earning my bread for the day and it is needless to say after sharing the precious moments with my lovely family .
I often participate in friendly matches to keep physical abilities up to the mark .
While putting lot of stress on physical abilities , it is needless to say the day can be tiresome if one may decide to play in the longer version of the game , but it is equally challenging how you would keep up your mantle status .
It does require to explore your brain while developing strategies against the opponents .
It becomes essential to create a spontaneous Plan B when Plan A did not work .
Top of all , one has to learn to maintain the sportsmanship , irrespective of the result or heated moments on the field .
In the present world television is very important .
But sometimes it can also affect us in a negetive way .. most people around the world can see any news in live.media is more help full for the people .television is also using as a study material for example smart classes ,
online courses etc . television is more important media we can improve our language with the help of the television.now we can see
that so many films with the help of television and we can see other programs also.according to the present world without television
no one can live as a human being so that we can say that television is more impotent .

There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is cheaper than public transport .
commuters prefer to travel by car compared to public transport .
The main reason for people do n't like to travel by public transport is due to overcrowding
Travel by train is very expensive nowadays .
People prefer the car rather than public transport due to sexual harassment .
Dear Federico ,
Like you know , I was work in a youth camp the last year , so that if you want to take this job I would like say some things that will help you .
In the positive side , the size of the groups is really small .
I had 25 children and it is a good number for working well .
This kind of job is very useful if you want improve your English skills .
I recommend this experience .
On the negative side are the labor conditions . The money is not enough for pay the level of living in London and else the money for " travel expenses " , in my case , arrived until November !
Can you believe it ?
In any way , I recommend that you take the job for August , because I have listened that in this month the organization is better than in July .
I wish you luck and a good experience .
Regards , Alex

Nowadays , each family has several cars to use for their daily needs .
It 's much faster much more convenient than using public transportation .
The only drawback that comes along using cars is limitation in fuel resources .
However , it seems that each day a new source for extracting fuels is exploring .
Beijing is the capital of China , it is the political , economical and cultural center , but also a city of long history .
It was the capital of Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty.so it has many ancient architecture , like Ming Tombs , the Summer Palace , The Temple of Heaven , the Forbidden City .
Especially the Forbidden City is the largest architectural complex which is best - kept in the current .
It represents the highest architectural achievement in the ancient China .
The Great Wall is located in the north of Beijing .
It is more than thousands of mails long .
It has been starting build from Qin dynasty , Its use was to resist Huns , but now it is a great place to visit .
These architecture also represents the culture of China .
Beijing is also a city which has many kinds of snacks and foods from different countries .
You can taste Peking Duck , Sichuan spicy diced chicken , Henan stewed noodles and Yue dishes ...
Now Beijing is a large international city , it will inherit the elements of history and develop much better .
" The reality of transportation is that it is future oriented .
If we 're planning for what we have then we are behind the curve " , Anthony Fox .
Transportation has a major role in a society as life revolves around motion .
When we talk about convenience , comfort and safety then private transport is more likely to consider .
In certain emergency cases , running for a bus seems harder than jumping up in your own car .
Private transport is totally on your own , so there remains no tension of reaching a certain station on a specific time .
Travelling privately makes one free of the issues as harrasment .
Although many transport providers look forward to eradicate this problem , yet it remains .
Public travelling may trouble the passengers due to increasing fares .
People often tend to go on their own as private transport such as cars can be bought easily on loans provided by banks .
Looking on a wider span , cars are these days available according to the public demand .
For instance , fuel - efficient , luxurious and economical cars are easily available .
With the advancement of the automobile industry , public transport will not be considered as the first choice in the coming years .
The above discussion suggests that people find private transport a safer , convenient and comfortable mode of travelling .
The city was deserted that night , as Michael and I wandered through the narrow streets .
It had been raining earlier and the full moon shone brightly on the wet stones .
Suddenly we heard the sound of running footsteps .
Then there was a cry and the footsteps stopped .
Nervously , we walked back .
Perhaps someone had been killed , or kidnapped in the street
We were going to see what happened , and we had something to see .
There was one old granny who was beat up .
We try to gave her help but she was so heavy and we could not do that . Than we were trying to find help ,
but nobody was opening doors .
On our luck I had a mobile phone , but Michael was saying that we need to escape because we did not know are those bullies near the corner .
My plan was to phone my dad and an ambulance and I 've done that .
After we came to the ambulance , police come and one patrol was catching those man who made that to that granny and the other patrol was talking to us .
I found out that granny name is Rose and she had got operation after the accident .
To our relief , she was saved and when we went to granny room , we saw smile on her face .
We were also happy , but in Michael head came a lot of things .
He knew that if we escape at that moment when the granny was at the ground , she would most probably die .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
My name is Kamaldeen I 'm 31 years old I 'm married and I do n't have children .
I moved with my family from Jordan to Saudi Arabia in 1995 .
I began studying when I came to Saudi Arabia in third grade .
I rose up in Al Qassim region and I lived the best time in my life in Al Qassim .
I have big family contains from my father and mother and I have seven brothers and three sisters .
I studied in Al Qassim University and my major Microbiology .
I graduated from my college in 2001 after that I got job in ministry of health and I have been working there since 2010 .
I like a lot of activities such as travelling , readillng , play soccer and watch movies .
I still believe that public transport will be more popular in the future due to benefits it provides for us . Travelling by car is more convenient but expensive .
Travelling pubic is cheaper .
On the other hand , not everybody can own the car .
Public transport is suitable for those who have no own car .
Besides , public transport will reduce traffice jam .
Today , government focus on how to improve public transport and they also increase their supporting .
So public transport is improved continuously .
I think it will be the favourite transportation for all of us .
My favorite sport is volleyball .
This sport cause fresh and jolly me and I think will exercise cause healthy.if you start volleyball , you need a ball and piece of ground that separate with tie .
Shopping takes place the biggest part especially to women , but sometime it becomes not so enjoyable and I agree with this statement .
First of all , shopping is not satisfying when you are tired , or you are hungry , or maybe it is just your personality who does n't like crowds of people walking around .
Secondly , if you can not find what you are looking for , you will not beam with happiness .
What is more , you will not be satisfied with the shopping if you lack money and can not afford to buy the thing which you really want .
To sum up , I would like to say that , if you are in bad mood or lack of money then you will not be able to feel pleasure of it .
Human live has change a lot in the last years , and it seems that this will happened faster every day , the technology advances and the changes in the way of thinking , are adapting to a different kind of people with each human generation .
Technology advance way to fast and it is really difficult guessing what kind of stuff or artefacts will be fifty years from now , but we can guess some ideas like flying cars , smartphones with the size of a small paper , laptops really thin like quarter of inch , clothes that clean itself or change the color and shape , healthier food , smarter electrodomestics .
All this will help people to live easily , but only to have more time to work , because the type of mind that reign that time will focus in the companies and make money and spend it , this is the reason why a lot of jobs are changing to a home office and the firms are giving more and more facilities to their employees to be more efficient .
At the end , the kind of live that we will see in fifty years from now will have a lot of stuff to help the people to have a more comfortable , easier and faster way of live , but this will be only to meke more money and consume more and more , also the things will be faster of waste to make the people to change their apparel more often and create a consumerism .
Nowadays , an increasing number of people are concerned about the phenomenon that armland , forest and wetland is disappearing for some long - term human activities , for instant housing and transport networks is builded by destroying the balance of environment .
Firstly it is clear that more house and transport networks is convenient for our people , what is knowed to us is that the population growth is a big problems , which is needed for more palce to living .
And builing more transport networks is also benifit for us , for example , the high - speed rail can be shorteded our time in traveling.while the animal may not welcome to it ,
In order to command the psychology of user , it was necessary for me to know the new tendency of UI
design .
Therefore , with the good UI design , many people will have the user experience with pleasure .
The good user experience will be good to collect data and be good for making a decision in commerce .
Once upon a time there was living a little girl in a small town .
She was very shy , sensitive and embarressed .
She dreamt about living in a big city where anyone would n't know her .
She had just wanted to hide from this world .
Her name was Lora .
Lora has grown up and become a very pretty adult .
She has mooved to Kyiv , graduated from university and started to work .
Althought she tried to hide she has become a great and a famous model .
She has even got a boyfriend , Michael .
She loved him ..
He was her first man , best friend and lover .
He was everything for her .
He loved her for her flame .
He wanted to own all she had .
From time to time it seemed to him that he loved her .
But it was very short emotion .
Once Lora came and told him that she was sick .
She cried .
But Michael was n't worried .
Lora noticed his coldness .
She asked him to go .
She was killed by his coldness .
He went out .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Football is my favorite sports In my life.so,I pay more attention to it than any other things you might think of .
I had been following series of football 's events in and around the world at large .
I took this time to command people who are sacrificing their entire life of the betterment of sportsmanship .
With all that , I do have my favorite club team n country as well .
And also have my favorite players , Ronaldinho , Messi and Eto'o .
My favorite club is Barcelona and country is Cameroon although that I am from Liberia .
I know football does n't go by sentiments but the love of choice and what desire you the best .
What really makes me to love Barcelona is that they play the football , instead of them running around .
They always bring talented players that will make the club be more improved tactically.people always say this;"Barcelona does n't buy players"it 's not like , they are lacking money .
We do essential purchasing of players to save more money .
You have to save money for players to enable you to pay them on time .
As normal humanbeings , you have to know how to spend money , where , when to spend it.it's not because you have more money then you lavish it .
So , i love my team and my staff and how they run things in my team .
The facts should not be hidden Barcelona is the best club team in the world , you like or not .
I am writing about the international sports I have seen monthly magazine .
I enjoy this sport because it is comfortable and elegant also you never hurt yourself badly .
Furthermore , you also have a lot more confidence in yourself .
The advice I would give to someone who starting this sport .
first of all you should eat healthy food to have a good physic , do more exercises and sleep less .
Most people who play Tennis are always ready and proud about themselves .
Every day I wake up at 05:00 AM and go to bed at 10:00 PM .
I reach home at 13:00 then I take my lunch and relax for an hour .
In the evening I watch movies .
we all know that do sport is very important to keep our life healthy and happy .
My favourite sport actually is walking;and I prefer walking in the morning and before sundown .
I like also walking in public street , gardens , clubs and on the shore.when i want to go anywhere;I do my best to go on foot .
I like this sport since my childhood because I found that I can think about my good time when I was child and relax with myself to think carefully about my present and future .
The walking can also fitness and do the knee stronger .
It would be interesting to accompain your best friend or your beloved to enjoy your time .
I advice my guys who suffer from laziness and overweight , try to walk one hour at least and after that they will like this sport .
Hi !
I want to begin with one thing : I do n't have a favorite sport or something on that , but I really like to do exercises for my body .
I think it 's important to maintain our tone and of course our health .
Because , when we practice a sport or some simple exercises we feel how the body receives energy , that it 's happening with me .
But we have concrete examples , which we should wear follow and which already demonstrated that nothing it 's impossible .
Like Nadia Comaneci or Gica Hagi , they are two people which succeeded in their sport but with perseverance and ambition .
They are passionate by that they do , more concrete those are fall in love with their job .
It is an important thing to love and like a lot what we practice , because that it 's the key .
The pleasure and your will will help you to succeed and to get the best scores .
In my point of view , this subject , the sport , the favorite sport is one of most pleasant for me .
I love to do joking in the morning and then to do a lot of exercises for my legs and arms .
If I do that , now the day is one of my best days , it 's a managed day for me .
In conclusion , I do n't have a favorite sport , I like to do a little of all and I do n't refuse nothing .
Flori .
This crime was happened about six years ago .
It was in Italy , exatly in Bergamo .
Yara finished one of your training .
Her parents , after an halp past hour of the training 's finish , became preoccupied .
The parents called her , but she did n't answer .
Then , when she did n't return at home , her parents reported the passing of their daughter .
The surveys were concentraded above all in the construction site of Mapello .
In December 2010 , Fikri was banged - up by the police .
Three month after her passing , she was rediscovered dead along the stream .
Definitely , the public transportation does n't have any future .
A good amount of the population prefer to buy a car to go to the school , work place , church on a faster on comfortable way .
Every year thousands of car are sell and the demand is growing .
Probable the only opportunity to change this will be to remark on people the opportunity to save energy and diminish the environment contamination if we use public transportation .
Television has many advantages .
It is not only entertains , but also educates .
There are many educational programmes which we can get penfit of it .
Good films can also entertain and educate at the same time .
Football is the most popular sport followed in Italy and in Europe , in fact there is some important tournament where participate all important Europe team , They are called " Champions League " and " Europa League".football is a team sport in fact in this sport participate everyboby without exclude nobody .
The people start to play football in a regulatory pitch , after some time they will be tired , but it is normal because their muscles are not enough strong for running around the pitch for many times .
If you often train your muscles will become very strong .
Another thing you do not have is the ball control .
The ball control is the control you have when you run with the ball .
you can improve it running with the ball and gradually you will improve your ball control .
How to make true mistake ?
I 'll tell you a story happened at school

Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Pollution as a problem in the environment
Years ago , pollution was not a big problematic to deal with .
Technology was not as advanced as it is now , so the amount of waste was small .
Our ancestors used to live in a unselfish life .
Nowadays , pollution is a plobelmatic that we have to solve before it gets worse .
A new way of transport mut be included .
We are used to driving a car and we do not notice how much damage we cause . We should start using new ways of transport as go by bike or by walking .
Not only will solve pollution , also it will help us to discard obesity .
We Should include new alternatives of transport in our routines .
Rivers and seas are victims of modernization .
We have no idea of how much damage factories causes to the rivers and seas .
In fact , the factories waste goes to the rivers .
The government should improve a new law to regularize this damage .
As we can see modernization is causing damge in rivers and seas .
In my opinion , Pollution is a problematic on the entire world , not only in modern countries , so we should try to recycle more , any kind of help is necessary .
Dear grandmother ,
How are you ?
I haven't seen you for a long time .
I have a new beautiful pair of shoes .
These are white with black and blue lines .
I love it .
My mother gave me for my birthday .
I 'm going to celebrate my birthday next week in my house .
Would you like to come ? I 'm going to invite all my friends and family .
It 's going to be amazing .
See you soon .
Jazmin .
Hi Jo ,
I am very happy because the time spent very fast .
I did n't have anything news about you .
You can come here when you have time because my house is your house .
While you are with me , you will do curriculum vitae and after we will travel around my country and we will become a good workerds .
This idea is fantastic , although this will be very complicated .
However the best option is that you came here and after I present my friends and their fathers because they can help with your job .
On the other hand , I do n't recommend travel because this is very expensive .
If you came here , you will see a lot of country and you travel around the world .
But it is your decision , these options are my advice .
I will look forward to your notice about your decision , but I am very nervous because if you are with me , I will have the best summer in my life and I will be very happy because we will do parties with a lot of friends .
You must remember that the money are very important in your decision .

And i went to open the door .
I was really comfortable in my bed i coudnt belive that someone interrupt my calm .
But , whatever , i wen .
To the door and open it , result that was my brother .
After that say hi and go with him inside , he told me that our mom was goon to a trip for a week and we have to take care of my little sister .
I was a little worried because i love my sister but she was younger and i had a lot of work .
Whatever i decided to said yes and prepared myself to take care of her .
My brother go and he promised to return later with my sister .
I closedthe door whishing never have to opened again , then i went to the bathroom and took a relax shoower .
I practise Pilates Method every Sunday morning .
I like this sport because it is a simply healthy sport that respects my body .
I practised danse a long time ago but with ages , I 've preferred to practise an easier sport .
I discovered Pilates 2 years ago and began with a old Bejar dancer .
He took time to explain each movement and made me understanding the concept .
After 10 times I obtained results on my body : stretch , sinewy and flexible .
If I could give advices to new practisers of Pilates , it should be to read a book about this method and to take time choosing a goog teacher .
A few years previously I took part in one programme name called Christmas Drama .
In my school ages I did not participate any programme even sports .
Because school teachers never encourage me to participate .
If they told me to attend compulsory I will do without any hesitation .
While I were in ANDRAPRADESH every year we have Christmas function in December although we are not interested to attend Drama they were not leave us without participation even simple character .
They gave me a character like THE GOD .Firstly I never aware about how act and do this particular character .
And from October to till December we practise everyday after our study hour up to eleven " O"CLOCK.DAY BY DAY I learn and finally I did my role well .
Then I think myself why I wasted all my school days .
Personally I believe that those who are not participate any activity the teachers has them to encourage .Then only they also know how talented they are .
Every student should attend and show their talent .
After some ages we can not attend any this type of activity because we all are become old .So let do and enjoy your young age be happier .
The future of public transport in developed countries is very different , because most people have a car , in the people who live in poor countries , most people take public transport , because people does n't have a car and is cheaper take public transport , the pollution of public transport is huge and is growing third world countries should have , eco friendly transport .
I did n't use to believe in that people would do everything for advantage , even betraying family and friends .
I thought that was only seen in film .
The real world would not like that .
I strongly believed people would rather have love in the heart than everything .
I was n't rich , not having many good things , only a sample person , but I lived happily .
At least I had a stable job , lover , family and friends .
However , these things have changed , All the things I have been owning , building , remaining are broken .
It is hard to believe my eyes that I could see the avidity under their eyes , as if they could n't wait to see me dead , they ca n't become brilliant so long as I am alive .
I have always tried to convince them that I am not that bad some people said .
My family live in the city center of Madrid but I do n't like living here because it is noisy and there is contamination , so I decided to move to the county side two years ago .
I love this place because it is relaxing but the only problem for me is I live alone and I 'm lonely .
My mother knew my feeling and she wanted help me .
She came to my house with a present last week and when I opened it ... I could n't believed it " It was a little and beautiful monkey !
I was so exciting and very happy .
For me it was like to have a new member of the family and he lived with me .
Since these moment my life changed and now I go to every place with " Yango " monkey 's name
Dear Sir / Madam
I am writing this letter in order to apply for the job in the " usa summer camps " .
I saw the job advertisement in the local newspaper .
To start with , I would like to tell you that I have studied gastronomy in the Instituto Crandon , one of the most recognised institutes in Uruguay , also , I have just finished the sports and health course in the Universidad de la Republica , in which I learned to work from children to adults in the sports area .
I think every people love sport .
In the world very famous sport festival is Olympic .
There included many kind sports such as wrestling , basketball , tennis , running .. etc .
My favourite sports are basketball and martial art .
First , Basketball is team sport when it means i need to understand expression of members of team and keep contact them for example my roll is cutter but i need to do assister , blocker and guarding when i play .
Secondly , Every country have own martial art history and culture that is kungfu from China , taekwondo from Japan and Karate form Korea .
It not just fighting these sport give people durability , speed and power .
Especially i like karate and Kung - fu .
Man and women whose are possible to interest it .
There is not special criteria such a tall and strong muscle or gender .
These 2 sports improving human basic ability to reach as possible high capability .
I suggested to other people first to understand yourself such as what do you like , which is possible and than practice after every success
my favourite sport is badminton .
it 's a game between 2 or 4 people .
they use a bat and a shuttlecock which is like a bao feather .
purpose score most points .
I sometimes play badminton with my brother , and I always win .
I think I am good player .
my first play badminton when I was 7 years old .
positives ways for playing badminton : you can lose weight , you vision will be good etc
negatives ways for playing badminton : you right arm is more strong than you left arm , sometime , you are sprain your arm .
I 'm sure is very heath for your body .
According to this form , we can know learning knowledges takes a part of time in one day .
Unlike Taiwan 's senior high schools students , their sleeping time average in eight hours even more .
As for me , my daily schedule do n't have much options , just only study , sleep and others .
Others include in rest and exercise , but they do n't occupy lots of time .
In my awareness , I know United States advocates free - style study and self - learning , so they aside from study , they have diversity selections .
When it comes to my sleeping , I only have four to five hours in a day .
The lake of sleep often maks me ca n't concentrate in class .
the more remind myself to get up early , the more things i need to do .
So it usually postpones my sleeping time .
The only common option is rest time , I also spend three to four hours .
Because i think family and friends are my spirit medicine , they can give me lots of energy .
First , I am to say that People 's lives change in the future , because the new technologies will change the lives of people .
I think this , because the new technologies are created by people for improving our habits .
For example , Internet in the next 50 years will be very different , I guess that people will have a chip in our head and they may do many things with your mind like if we need to call other people , we will think about it and we may speak with it .
For other hand , People make other inventions for improving the world and reduce pollution , for example , In this time we have created electric cars or organic food , these things are very useful in future , because we will need to reduce pollution .
Also , People will need to improve medicine to cure diseases and for this , People need to create more inventions to resolve these problems .
Finally , I think that the best change will be in our lifestyle , We will change our clothes , thinking and other things , We will be more dependent and we need more things for our day to day .
Although I have been having terrible jet lugged since came back my country , It 's great to see my family and my friends .
Anyway I have to find a bird to develop myself and take a rest .
I never say goodbye to everyone because I will come back England .

Hi , Jenny
Well , as you asked me Jenny , the most brilliant actor than see before is Vin Deasel , it is an excellent professional and he protagonized a great deal of movies like the saga of Fast and Furious , Ridic , Nannies bulletproof and other extras films .
This is one of my favourite actor because , when he is recording a film he assume his role passionately and that is really important for a good actor .
Another of my favourites is Will Smith , he appeared in the well - known film , Men in Black and others excellent films like I am Legend .
This is for me and many people an excellent actor because his personality is extroverty .
So Jenny , here are my two favourites film stars .
I have to go shopping , sorry .
See you

This topic has controversial opinion these days , That everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university .
I am going to study the topics from both aspects and give my opinion in the matter .
A good percentage of people think that everyone should take a year off between leaving school and start college .
They think that year the student can spend in job to earn money so they can afford their expenses during college .
This way helps them also to explore the job market , some jobs are in great demand compared to others .
Or simply the student can spend this time travelling .
This way help them to get rid of study stress , and to give time to their social life .
Others think that if students take a year off study is unwise .
As return back to study may be difficult .
It is better to finish study first then go for work or having relaxation with travel .
both opinion have their merits .
In my opinion I Think it greatly depend on individual financial situation .
As I you have monetary that can cover your expenses on travel is totally different than if you have to work to cover your expense .
or you just have what is essential for education and university fees .
Transport is very important in our life , because we transport from place to other places .
the development technology and Industry very fast , so the public transport no future ,
Must be Interesting the development transport Even fits the times .

hello , good morning
I enjoy my favorite sport because I like running , playing and go to the forest .
This sport is healthy and good for the body . you should starting this sport for you feel good .
your muscule will be hard .
for this is necessary drink water , eat fruit , vegetables and pasta .
we do n't chould eat sweet and sugar .
if you want to start this sport , you should start running thirty minutes .
Thank you for showing your interest in my village concerns with the environment .
The town , Lahori , has been known for its practices to preserve nature . in our town , we conduct monthly meetings concerning waste management , as well as pesticides .
We are very appreciative of Dr. Manjot Baqri , who has taken upon himself to lead these meetings and educate our village on health problems associated with improper dispose of the waste . the village has built pits to dispose waste .
The fact of using a cart to transport , is essential in life , and that depends on the car you want to buy and save gas .
When you drive you must take precautions at all times because if you can not cause an accident
Link Remember that a car is to make your life easier to transfer and save as a way also to bring security because you go in your car and is less likely to get mugged or something .
Some desventejas may not have the money to maintain it , and they always remember that the car should give you a service and not to him , which is why you always keep it in line with the engine so you do not fail .
One day I visit my friend Jimmy in New York city , he was a young man who was specialist on trains and tourism , he talked about how the citizens and the commuters move from one place to another , he told me that the grand central terminal was the largest terminal of the city , he show me were the landmarks of the big apple were so sightseers could go , he show me the city and we went to different parts first he took me to Columbus circle in the south west corner of central park were there were the most expensive apartments then we went to the lake were the jogging tracks that circle the lake area popular with early morning visitors , then we went to the museum of natural history that was located near the metropolitan museum of art then I got focal on the subway trains so we went to Grand central terminal when we arrive I was amazed to see many people going to work so he told me that it was conveniently for people to use the train because is very fastest and for the government it was a grat economic business then he told me that one of the characteristics of
In the era of technological advancement , everything goes beyond one 's expectation .
There are mobile phone which has a face to face communication ; the transportation driven by solar cell energy .
In addition , the advancement of transportation system which is developed day - by - day performs to the most convenient and the fastest as they can .
Even though the personal car was consumed more and more because of its convenient ; in my opinion , unstoppable transportation development will perform public transport to be more popular than travelling by car .
The number of people in the world is continually increased .
This makes the city be crowded .
Imagine if everyone has individual cars , may we walk on the top of the car to meet neighbour by the next door .
Therefore , public transportation is deemed significant in order to reduce density on the road , the traffic .
In the first paragraph , I 've written that the transportation development will never lose place for public transport .
Firstly , there are a lot of methods to travel ; for example , buses , trolley buses , Metro , BTS , train , ship .
Secondly , public transport improve itself to be more functional and help support people .
For example , comfortable seats , system support for the handicap or physical disability , time capture that help people to know the fix time when the bus come , as well as security support that help people to be more confident to travel .
Lastly , public transportation make you sure to arrive on time .
You do not worried about the traffic jam , or try to find the car park .
All taken into account , the public transport has a much more useful and convenient , both individuals and commercial .
Although the personal car is popular , the public transport is still be valuable for the country
Dear Chris ,
I would like to spend this Saturday with you ) )

Summer vacation is so desirable that those in school or workplace long for it .
To most students , weekend is essential to them , because they are not allowed to play computer games until the weekends .
In my opinion , weekend not only gives us enough time to take an adequate break but allow us to enrich ourself .
Similarly , summer vacation give us more time to do meaningful things .
Such as visiting museum , seeing touching movies , doing exercises and so on .
Only by constantly do conducting my daily routine can I learn more information and become stronge
In important meetings like UN General Assembly or G77 , many leaders of power countries raise the environmental problems as the most concerned problem in their internal policies .
Disaster on the environment not only cause many problems to human but also to all diversity of life .
As a part of diversity , people , therefore , seek ways to reduce cause and effects of these coming disaster .
Firstly , I sometimes use my mom 's bicycle to university taking part to reduce the carbon dioxide emission from my car .
Riding a bicycle also a kind of eco - friendly transportation .
Next step , I reduce using some of the cosmetic products that provide or made from the materials cause a greenhouse effect .
There are also many related products which harm the environment .

My favourite sport is swimming .
Since I was young I like swimming and when I grew up I told my mum that I want to make competitions .
The first time it 's difficult like other sport because you do n't know and you have to imporve by yourself but if you like it you will find fascinating .
Also I remember my first competitions , I did n't win I was like the 4th but I was n't sad because I though that the next time I will do my best and probably I would win .
I went to swim like 4 hours a week and it was amazing because I improve a lot and right now I 'm one of the best .

In conclusion I 'd like to offer my aid if anything would be necessary .
Regards .
Myth and fable are always my favorite types of stories , because they can either be easy to understand or extend deeper matters .
Sometimes it is interesting to know a story by discovering their background first , is n't it ?
For example , due to the wide spreading of " The Epic of Gilgamesh " , we all heard something relate to it , but do n't really know about details .
Amount of tradition and legend nowadays somewhat refers its context , such as Homer 's " Odyssey " , the flood mentioned in the Bible , and especially Mesopotamian civilization .
Therefore , I try to find out more information about " The Epic of Gilgamesh " in order to understand it completely .
In conclusion , i hope that Riyadh city will be more interested in traffic jams .
If the government gives attention in improving the streets , decreases using cars , provides other transportation , and controls traffic jams by police , Riyadh will become a great city so the people do n't worry about going out .
I hope this problem will disappear soon .

In the future , this tendency will be continuing more and more specific social networking sites between business and personal life .

Having used cars to fulfill our transportation needs within the city limits it is a very good option for many of us , however the necessity of travelling overseas or even outside of our suburban areas might require a different sort of transportation , therefore is where the public transportation should focus on since the long trips taking more than a simple commute in the city would require it .
It has been a popular American tradition for many years now , since the mid-60s that we all use cars owned by private parties in order to meet our needs , hence considered the " modus operandi " ever since .
A new thinking might help to address this issue : transportation itself , perhaps , it is in need of evolution , that might be the use of public transportation , it has proven to be the best manner to get to places which roads and geographical areas might happen to be unknown to the traveller .
Firstly , all people can buy a lot of type of some things in my city for example in the centre of the city we can be souvenirs because this town has got old monuments , theatre and churches .
In north of the city people sell all types of food .
Normally this food are made when people did in the past , although , the best street market is in the west of the city .
On the other hand , you should visit a bookshop in a street marker .
However you can read a book while you can eat and drink some things in the sofa of street .
You must remember that in the center of the city , you can visit the bakeries with the best sweets and bread of world and these sweets are cheaper than in other towns .
Finally , people can know the biggest shopping center of Spain , the situation of this shopping center is in the national street 445 in west of the city .
You can see modern clothes while you eat in a restaurant and you can take photos with a tv star , because they buy in this shopping center and you feel a star , because you see a famous person and you think that you are in a film .
The movie I decided to review for you is thriller called The destiny .
The plot of movie is set in a small town where everything has its own eyes and because of that you must be aware of your behaviour .
All it begin when daughter will come to visit her mother and her step father .
What I liked most was that you think you know what is going to happen but for your surprise it always turns up for something unexcepted .
Despite the fact that there is n't any holywood star all the characters are played very believable and some scenes wo n't let you sleep .
Even the scenery is not based on real story it will makes you think about accidents happening around you .
There is n't anything special what I dislike maybe except for the music which was used there .
Sometimes I felt that the background songs do n't match with what was happening but after all you are in expectations of next step so you would n't mind it .
I highly recommend this movie to everyone who wants to see happening unpredictable situations and likes the feeling of unknown .
Hi Isabel ,
I love this new place .
The town is called white city .

My fovourite place is the beach that is near , just about 20 miles away from my flat .
I hope you can come soon .

In toward to modernization of life and technology the people belief in different perspective about way of life , but majority of ones is totally utopic .
Everyone wants a particular objects and individual life , as an egoistic human being ; however the realm world hasn't capacity to support these ideas .
Actually , we have a lot of problem with traffic : lots of cars in the railway and it do n't running ; the number of cars in the street cause a dirty pollution ; crawded railways causes a later destination .
In the biggest cities around the world the traffic nonstop and increase every day .
We descovery , in this perspective , special deseases by traffic : stress , violence , pollution , insecurity , so on .
For this reason , I believe that in the future we will return to use a green combuster and public transport .
If the public transport will be by higher quality , faster and fewer rates , majority of citizens will be prefer : is more calm to relax and read a newpaper or a magazine during the way in a collective transport than an indiivdual one ; moreover , the time spend up to go and came back will be reduced , because it promotes less car in the railway .
Thus , in the future , public transport will be more interesting than particular and individual transport .
Last month , my friend came to Korea and visited me .
In the morning We went to Ocean Park , we saw dolphin , cat , horse and many animals .In the afternoon we went to play rollar coatser , I screamed on top of voice and called for help .Actually I hate playing rollar coster .We played mind train , punch and a lot of games .At the end of the day I was just like running out of gas , because I was too tired to walk any further .
Last day , I gave her a photo that was our first hang out and we hugged each other , she gave me a present and called me to keep it for her .
Nowadays , students have a lot of various form of education . They may not only learn in school but also through the Internet .
It has both advantages and disadavantages .
The main advantage of learning per Internet is time saving .
When we attend a school we often waste time on buses which we may intend to studying .
In case of Internet learning we can oneself set hours of learning .
Also , possibility of learning at home is a big advantage , especially for people who prefer peace and silence .
Then it 's better to concentrate of learning and we do n't feel any pressure or stress connected with asking and tests .
On the other hand , through the Internet learning on a long term we could feel bored or lonely , School gives opportunity of learning in group when students may help each other and resolve problems .
Another disadvantage of learning per Internet can be issue with Internet connection .
It not always work correctly .
A mind that lost it .
Malcolm Young is a guitarist that with his brother founded the rock band : AC / DC .
He never has been the most famous guitarist in the world , He was just one more guitar player .
He has lived behind the shadow of his brother , the leader guitar and one of the most important guitarist .
However he never has thought in this like a problem .
He just do his job , play guitar and sing like a second voice .
But if you research about what he has done for ACDC , you realize that he was an important man .
A lot of AC / DC 's songs were written and composed by himself .
He has been the AC / DC 's mind .
But Why I did this article about someone who looks like a simple guitarist , the reason is just one , the life , this man who one day just disapper from the fanactics ' eye .
On April 2014 he was unable to do performans .
On sepmtember 2014 , a note was realized and published in AC / DC 's webpage , the note said : " Malcolm is taking a break from the band due to ill health " .
But the true was worse , Malcolm has had an illness since 2014 and daily he is worse .
Dementia is the illness .
The dementia is an illness that affect the brain , people 's memory were lost , Malcolm do n't remember who is the people surround him .
Around a year ago , a video was made by Brazilian radio .
The video show us how dementia sufferers ' reaction to listing ACDC 's music .
in the end we read a sentences : " Although you might someday forget about the world , the world will never forget you , Malcolm , "
Live you only have a life , today , perhaps tomorrow you lost all .
My name is samy .
I'm 22 years old Egyptian .
When I was young , I enjoyed playing basketball .
I thought that it 's the best sport ever .
It made me fit and strong .
It taught me the meanings of teamwork and leadership .
I Kept playing basketball 4 years continuously till I joined the secondary school .
My advice to anyone starting basketball is to never giving up and always keep playing till the last minute .
We are not alone . We live with people whome are family for us .
Relationship can be very different ?
from the best to the worst .
But sometimes we start to call our sisters and brother our enemy , without the reason .
Who brink up ?
Who care about us ?
Who try to make us happy ?
Our enemy ?
Of course no .
Our family is people who will love us , do n't look on situations and who we are .
We are always small and careless children for our parents , small and foolish for our elder brothers and sisters .
And i can clearly say that they are our friend . We are part of them and they are part of us .
So we need to stand together .
Television and other things invented by tecnhology are part of our lifes .
I think every family has got a television in own home and for example I have 4 televions in mine .
For me television has advantages and disadvantages .
It 's important if we want to know news of our country or world 's news .
There are a lot of interesting tv programs where we can learn something and there are also intriging television programs .
These are advantages but we can have also disadvantages from them .
For example we can become addicted to our television .
It is not the best thing for our eyesight and our helth .
In general I think our technology is not the best thing for our health and tv and other similar things are responsable for our problems with helth and eyesight .
So television has positive and negative aspects and it 's up to us how to behave with it .
As keep our mind good and healthy we need to spend our some times in sport .
I like cricket is the best among all of these sports cricket is a good mind refreshing game
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
After calling the ambulance , he waited outside his car someone who could help you .

She is a nurse , but he did n't receive any reply .
He thought that he must do something or his friend could die .
They had a car accident , and fortunately he had n't injury but his friend Sam was fainted .
He tried to stop some cars that passed through the street , but it was useless .
The ambulance arrived .
Sam was visited but beside the scary he had only some bruises .
He came with him to the hospital and at last it was a success story .

One of her favourite things to do is drawing , she has lots and lots of special pens , crayons , highlighters , paint .... AS you see she is an artist at drawing .
She says she is n't good at maths , even though she likes them .
So ... This is Adriana and some things about her .
My favourite sports are cycling and swimming .
Swimming is very excited .
Although you do n't know how to swim , you would love it .
In Hong Kong , it is very hot in summer .
There are many swimming pools in Hong Kong people love to swim with their families , friends or their children .
People in Hong Kong love to go cycling in holidays , too .
Some people used to do cycling as relaxing .
People like cycling alone the river .
Doing sport is very important in our lives . We need to do more sports to make us healthy .

The last mistake that I have had to have been when I changed the telephone company because since I changed I have many troubles .
All company are the same , any solve your problems .
I have had to put a claim because the company did n't resolve .
After a month I did n't know when I will receive my telephone .
All this began because the first telephone that I received It was faulty .
The company had to send me other telephone , this telephone turned out to faulty also .
Since that moment all have been problems .
Now , I have to wait an answer the company .

When I started to study here in Australia . I have been found the difference of curriculum in my home country .
It is really crucial for me to adopt their way of teaching at this time .
In my home country , when I was in the University it has a little bit easy for me to follow the educational policies .
The learning style is a traditional learning that is usual thing in my country .
In addition , the type of examination is more on memorization , that I can use my own language that help me to understand it easier .
" In particular , many international students are too teacher dependent on uncritical of material that have been thought , prone to role memorization , they misunderstand the cardinal sin of plagiarism , and lack of knowledge of the genres of academic writing " .
In contrast , to my present learning , it is precisely crucial .
The academic style is more on critical thinking , it is hardy to cope up , because I need to understand it using their language .
Clearly , multiple factors have had major influence or the nature of the student population , attending universities and now this shift affects , and is affected by university policy and practiced are important issue .
As an international learner , I embraced these changes in my learning strategies , primarily because these new learning strategies of academic style significant for my future course .
It has challenged me to adapt in a Universal approach to learning style back in my country .
Julia 's anecdote is not a fact , but a fiction .
It 's a bookseller called " A droga da obediência " that the author is Brazilian .
The story is about five friends that begin investigate a drug traffic happening inside at school .
However , one friend disappears then the four friends decided to discover where is him .
It 's a mystery story with a moral , because for surprise of reader , the director was the drug dealer that produced the drug inside the classes .
The moral is about the students do n't be naïve and take care of unscrupulous men that sell drugs .

I have a dream to continue my study until Phd .
However , I think that it is not an easy thing to be achieved because of the limitation about information of scholarship .
In addition , I work as civil servant who should follow the government rule .
Actually , I do n't give up and always looking for the opportunities .
In my opinion , education is a way to improve our life quality .
In other words , it can change our paradigm and mindset also into better perspectives .
In the broader capacity , it can help my nation 's position in the world perspective .
Therefore , I do not try to erase my ambition .
Everything is possible as long as we have effort .
travelling is an essential in everybody 's life .
Although the number of cars are increasing day by day , however most of the people traveled through the public transport .Their limited income restrict them to buy cars .
also the main drawback of cars is the environmental pollution .
Therefore public transport has its own importance .
In order to avoid the environmental pollution , people should use the public transport that will not only help to reduce the pollution but also the extra expenditures for the petrol .
government should focus for the improvement of public transport and must discourage the individual cars .
Hi Richard ,
Thank you for your money .

Take the best care .

Hello Jo .
Good I am going to throw a hand .
My advice to travel for Spain is that there are several types of transport but the most economic is the public , most expensive transport can be the taxi , for example .
But , you can travel by plane , it is not very expensive .
My advice of finding work , is a bit complicate because nowadays there are a lot of people without work .
But you can been lucky because the summer is very near and the work increase .
Your you can find work , since you have the learned English , in a bar , in a hotel , etc .
Well , I wish the best thing you and that you find work .
Good luck

Dear Sir ,
I 'm writing this letter to tell you about my work last summer at my local cinema .
I liked my work there so much .
My work was about reserving tickets for the customers .
It seemed like a simple job to me , but it was also a very stressful job at rush times .
In the morning , we had small groups of people and the rush times started in the evening .
I am looking forward to hear from you about how did you spend your summer .
Sincerely ,
Gehad
Hi , My name is Gabriela Cordeiro Magalhaes ... I have thirteen years old .
I like playing games and read .
I 'm from Brazil .
My best friend is Jennifer Giordano , she 's Pretty and Smart .
I will recommend Huang Ji Huang to celebrate our farewell dinner .
Huang Ji Huang is located in popular district in North Jakarta which many people call it PIK .
This is China - based chain that is recently opened .
This restaurant has many awards in China before it opened in Jakarta .
The place of Huang Ji Huang is pretty big if you compared with the other restaurants in PIK .
The place is provided private room and karaoke room in one place .
Besides that the public room is also clean and comfortable , but I recommend you to choose private room to support our farewell dinner .
The waiters who worked here are kind and helpful , they serve the customers kindly and always explain the menu clearly , they are capable make their customer satisfied with the service .
Huang ji huang specialized in the stew pots menu , which will take you to enjoy an authentic Chinese food .
You can order packages menu that Huang Ji Huang offered or you can also choose the ingredients that you want for your stew pot but you must choose 3 until 5 ingredients .
Huang Ji Huang has 5 kinds of sauce which can give your stew pot become tasteful , and one of them is Mala Sauce .
Mala Sauce is a spicy flavor and it is very authentic and you will rarely find this taste in another restaurant .
But if you do not like spicy you can also try the Honey Sauce .
After all the food is very tempted to try and the size portion is big enough to share with 3 or 4 people .
The price is cheap if you compare it with the service and taste from the food .
Having farewell dinner here is worth the money .
Every month Huang Ji Huang always make a special offer from their cutomer , and for this month Huang Ji Huang will give 20% discount for customer who spend 500 IDR above , for a complete informatioj you can check it on the website or call the restaurant .
And I highly recommend you to make a reservation first if you decided to hold our dinner here , because this place is always crowded and we also need a private room .
I used all of the things except two .
I did n't have the Internet when I was child .
And also we could n't choose programmes .
I played in the street and walked to school alone .
I'm thinking what kind if things were more dangerous for me?It was so dangerous when my friends and I swam in the Tobol river .
We jumped into the water and caught crayfish .
When I remember that moment I am exciting .
I guess everychild want to investigate the world .
We have to help them , to show and explain .
What kind of risks they can get if to do that .
Nuclear energy is one of most important source to generate energy and heat for the people in the world .
The countries diurnal attempts to develop the industry of nuclear to produce more power .
There are many views of using the nuclear power .
Some people guess the nuclear power has a great value to produce power instead of the fossil fuels such as : coals and oil which are Not renewable energy .
Moreover , they think that controlling the pollution is possible .
Whereas .
The serious side of the nuclear power is the dangerous weapons that the countries try to own , threat the peace in the world .
These kinds of weapons do not kill one or ten but destroy a large town completely .
In my opinion using the nuclear power is important with the great development in the humans life.the countries have to establish this energy and other sources to secure the power for people .

My favourite way to travel is by plane because you are quickly in another country .
By plany you rarely have problems with your luggage .
By train you did n't will have always place for your luggage .
By plane you can give your luggage at the check - in or you can take the hand luggage with you . you can be always sure that you will find a place for your luggage .
Another reason why travel by plane is my favourite is because it is more comfortable to sleep except you have a loud person close to you .
That can be annoyand .
I think travel by boat is one of the baddest ways to travel when you are seasick .
Then you must travel by train or by plane .
BIG FISH ,
A VERY GOOD RESTAURANT WHOSE SPECIALITY IS " TAPAS "
Eating " tapas " is a very popular way of having a meal in Spain .
If you are not very hungry .
You can eat small pieces of different dishes and to have dinner or lunch inexpensively .
For more than thirty year in Nerja has been openend every day " Big Fish " a traditional restaurant with a typical cook of the coast of Málaga .
With your drink the first portion is on the house .
If you pay between one and three euros you can choose little dishes of fresh fish and different types of salads .
The portion of prawns is very famous as octopus salad , which is known by everyone .
The service is very organised and fast , although it might be in high season you would not have to wait a long time .
This restaurant only has a little problem .
You can eat " tapas " at the counter or in small tables near the bar .
The rest of the diningroom is exclusive by eating meals .
Discussions about genetic manipulation become strong when a specific area is mentioned : genetically modified food or GM food .
For several decades the population has been discussing arguments for and against GM food .

In the first quarter , we can see that sales rose , in the second quarter , sales went up but in the third quarter , sales were unchanged .
In conclusion , we can see that sales went up every time except the third quarter that it were unchanged .
this is good , because sales mever went down .
My favourite sport is football , I love it .
It is the most popular sport in the world .
I enjoy play it , particularly because it is a competitive sport and because you play with a team and not alone , and this for me is really important .
The thing I like best in football is play it , but I also like watching it , intact I am a fan of the team Lazio .
Some people think that the football is a bad thing because the footballer are all stupid and the fans are all violent and disrespectful , but it is n't like it .
Ok there are some fans who are n't good people but the most important associations of football are trying to stop they and to abolish all bad things in football .
For all the people I advise to start to play or watching football because for me it is a very good sport , but you can play a good football only if you really like it , because first football is fun .
As every year the twenty three of April , day of book , in my school all the student of fifth and sixth of primary do short story competition and the winner have a gift .
the gifts usually are a book and a ticket for the theme park in Madrid , and the children who have participated win a book .
Always the director of my school , called Michael , is who organizes this event for that the children have fun writing his shorts stories .
But this year , Michael is organizes very evil because he does n't enough books for all children and a lot of they had n't gift , so Michel had closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
I think my town really take care of the environment , because there are a lot of parkｓ in this town and these are very clean .
However some people are not care of environment that mean some people throw garbage away in the park .
I think almost everyone loves parks because a lot of people go to the park and having lunch , picnic , excersise , nap etc .
I think after eat something at the park then clean themselves is good .
Even though do not everyone doing that , so how much public office is care of environment is important and this town is care of that a lot .
Every morning some peasons are coming park and cleaned that makes feel really thanksgratitude .
When I am walking around here I can see a lot of beautiful gardens and roads are clean so I think many population are care of town as well .
There are many sports grounds for example tennis cort , football grounds and play equipment for child so I think my town takes care of environment that makes everyone will be able to best condition in both mind and body long time .
Espesialy there are a lot of greens these makes good health .
However someone have to take care of them .
The town have to do that and I think in England there are so many greens all around , so a lot of people take care of these that makes good environment .
After I have been to live in England with my family I have goton the feel very much indeed .
pain and gain
This movie is bases quote on quote on a " true story " buts obviously director michael bay know for the transformers franchise puts a lot of hollywood into this movie , its about a bodybuilder named daniel lugo who decides to kidnap a rich guy and make him sign away all of his properties , which obviously its not a great plan that backfires on him , and eventualy police get him .
Its a great funny movie especially for someone like me who enjoys going to the gym and lifting some weights .
Hi Julie ,
thank you for your present .
I love the T - shirt that you gave me for my birthday .
It is a very beautiful T because -shirt I like the colour and the pattern .
My day in London
I went to London in April .
It was pretty warm .
My family and I got a great feeling as we landed in London .
We saw a lot of sights like the Big Ben , which is the biggest clock in the world and the London Eye .
To got to the Big Ben we took the underground , but to get to the London Eye a red bus .
After 3 days we went home .
I forgot to tell you something about homeless people .
A lot of people are homeless , which is sad , but maybe we can change it .
Sport is very important for every one .
Old and young are benefit from sports .
My favourite sport is volleyball .
I like it very much . I practise it in the club .
I play it with my companions .
It makes my body healthy and strong .
when you score alot of points , you will win the match .
Genarlly sports is growing our mind continously .
I practise it with my friends .
I enjoy playing it alone or with my friends .
my parents always support me to play what like and
enjoy .
It make me lose weight easily without doing any effort .
I do n't find any difficulty in doing it .
My favourite sport is basketball .
Usually I only play basketball in school .
We play by teams or each one alone .
Of course we do n't have 2 million balls for each student no we share with each other .
Also , not all the school play in one time no every section have time to play in .
In school I always play with friends never played alone and always my friends and I wins .
Last time I played when won 14 by 5 .
do you know do I enjoy my sport I will tell you why because when you play you have fun and interested .
My advice for people who is starting this sport is to repeat playing until they get it .
My favourite soap opera is " Friends " . I remember to watching it at home at the age of twelve and laughing out lous with my brother .
I still watch it on Saturdays and I really enjoy it !
My favoutite character is Joey , who is a silly innocent man .
He live with Chandler , opposite Monica and Rachel 's flat .
It is very difficult to deny the importance of family in our life , definitely families play an essential role community structure .According to the experts we ca n't create successful society without creative families , and one another specific part of your life is a good partners surrounding your daily activities .
One of the main advantage of family is the recogniton you have been given in specific age , children required special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family .For instance , homeless children are more likely to fail in their education , job and adapt to society .
Consequently , they probably fail to experience from their live .
Moreover , families take an essential part in protect their members from bad atmosphere , and it probably reflect on their perfotmance toward country .leading to effictive , creative and useful civilians .
the last film I wachd was " the oders " by it is a horror / suspense movie , I was really scared .
It is about a family ( the mother and her two children nicholas and anne ) , the mother is crazy and thinks her children are allergic to the lightin general .
so the did n't come outside in the day , and in a room it could not be more than a candle at a time , it had to be always dark in the house .
Strange things happen in the house , they are " intruders " in the house , anne saw many times someone called victor who " play 's "
and the mother thinks she is lyeing but after a while she believe her and started searching for the intruders .
At the end theintruders turn out to be ghosts that

Public transportation
I think nowadays is more common that people use their car for their normal activities , but the statement that there ir no future for public transportation it is not completely true , I think that a lot of people use public transportation because it is cheaper and some people do n't have enough money to buy a car .
Another reason is that here in Mexico , in some cities you ca n't use your car in specific days , so if you do not have another car , you have to use public transportation .
Well , my college has been provide an organization called Enactus .
I 'm a member on it and its goal that improve the positivity of our society by setting projects serves many people who really needs our help .
So , we actually done 8 projects since i came in and i had a good feeling through helping other people .
we interned 2 national Competitions in 2 years and won second place on one of our projects and gained 2 leagues on other ones .
we made our university proud plus helping people .
Now , we are over 180 members in this organization and getting increase .
We need more of this organization cross the world and there is a lot of students ready for help and wishing for a chance to make our society a better place .
Nowadays , Ways of live have being Changing in many aspects .
Does why , is easy to believe that if things continue with this rhythm and transforming everything , in a closer future of 50 years everything is gon na be completely knew and different .
In the past , people were used to live the instant without concerning about the future .
Lives of everybody were the same and just some of them thought that what they were doing in that moment would have consequences in the future .
For that , everything were kind of similar and static for many years .
But then industrialization comes and with that , the technology , so ways of life 's started to change and everything start to go faster .
As I told you before because of the technology many things has become able in less time , and with the pass of the years this tend to increase .
For example , sharing knowledge and experiences allows that everybody can do or apply things and develops faster .
Also allows that researches can be share easily or for example you can get information about environmental problems that can affect you as we 'll so you can react faster and make some changes .
Another example of why lives are gon na changed completely in 50 years is because also that connection between others cultures make People concern more about her own health , the expectations of life and the way they want to live it , because everyday will be easier to see how much are we hearting the earth so we will see faster the impacts that this brings to our life .
As a result we will be need to change fast , to try to fix what we broke and star to rebuild in order to have that future or health that we dream of .
Least but no less , family perception , has being changed and for that time everything will be different because will be the effect of the decisions that women are making right now about having kinds .
They are tending to work as much as men 's , so is hard to have time for building a family or even some times is hard too , thinking about getting married .
So that , maybe would n't be young force worker in 50 years and people will spend all their time and money in their hobbies , sports , self care and traveling .

This premonition can not hold more true .
Traveling in public transport can be cumbersome and quite eventful .
Talk of getting to meet strangers who may turn out to be thiefs .
That is why i feel traveling by your own car is the best things that can happen to one person .
You get the convenience of traveling at your own pace and stopping when you please .
Someone has suggested putting warnings on some types of food and drink .
This suggestion is controversial .
On the one hand society become increasingly fat and kinds of warnings could be useful to remind them to eat clean .
On the other hand it 's hard to implement this idea .
The companies who produce products with harmful ingedients are very mighty so that this suggestion is very hard to enforce .
The example on cigarette packets shows that warnings like this could be useful .
the aim of this report is to provide assessment to relocate the current canteen of the campus to a location more accessible for all the students , hence it will hopefully prove both , the profitability of the canteen and the relevant role it plays for all the students in the campus .
One day , a man called Jonas was standing in front of a mountain when he saw a big bird of prey .
He was worried that the bird charged him , so the man seeks refuge and goes in a cavern .
Suddenly he understands that he has heard a noise so he decides to stay in the cavern away from danger .
It 's the day after and Jonas has put up all night in the cavern and at cold .
At dawn the man goes out from the cavern and look at the sky to see if there was the bird of prey .
Jonas does n't see the bird and think that the predatory had gone away , during the night .
So he decides to get home .
While the man was climbing the mountain , the bird pecked at Jonas who , worried , did n't know what to do .
He decided to take the penknife that he had in his bag , and he is successful in kill the bird of prey .
After two long day Jonas get home safe and sound and tell everything about his experience .
As all of us know that today 's generation prefers everything to be their own .
An in the process of owning we have moving so ahead that a day will be there when we will strongly claim that public transport does not have any future .
It will automatically diminish its presence .
As our country is developing there will days were each and every individual will be self reliant and would definitely prefer having their own vehicle to commute from one distance to the other .

Well I 'm Sebastian Vega and I 'm studying engeering sustainable development .
One of the things that I feel stressed are the finals exams , because I have to study for all the classes and sometimes I am very confused with my notes .
To be honest I take the finals exams like a challenge and it becomes exciting for me and I think I learn a lot if I have pressure and the most of the times I have good grade .
Sometimes I trust a lot and I have a bad grades so I feel depressed .
Nowadays the public transporte is n't hardly necessary for our life .
However , a lot cities have a problem about traffic , cause of this trouble that citizen do n't use public transporte such as autobus , taxi , or even metro .
Consequently , gorvernment start to support and take care of the public transporte .
Moreover it 's not only traffic 's problem but also bad condition .
Much toxic and exhaust flow to air .
How can we recover the pubilc transporte .
People are unpleasant because all of them have bad quality , so government ought to update new technology which protects the environment .
Now , the car price is very low 's cost so it very easy to buy a car .
The recenty years before , a family had only one car but today we have a car for ourselves .
Restaurant review
This restaurant is excellent !
It 's not very expensive and there are lots of choices on the menu .
Waiters are always smiling and they are very nice .
They wear black and white clothing like the decoration of the etablissment .
It is located in the city centre next to a big fountain .
They open from 11 am to 14 pm and from 8 pm to 10 pm .
And for spring and summer they open a beautiful and large terrace .
The atmosphere is very friendly .
The food is excellent and copious .
The baking of the meat is excellent .
The wait is not long , only a few minutes .
This restaurant should be the best for our class .
The best place for young people in our area is without doubt the countryside with the lake .
Here they can do many kinds of sport : swimming , sailing , surfing , kiting , rowing and many others .
At least they can meet other folks and relax , have a sunbathe and listen to the music .
In the summer around the lake are so many concerts so you have the difficulty finding the right one .
Luckily the scouls are closed per ten weeks , so the young girls and boys have much time to spend the
leisure time together .
in modern day there is very little public transpotr are used , ganeral public prefer much faster and conveninece ways of traveling around.though the pulic transport are used in mager citys to avoied traffic conjustion , it is wlidly reconizge that public transport are eco friendly .
public transport is used by many people around the world , including me .
Some public transports as trains do not contaminate as cars or motorbikes .
Many people said that public transport is not confortable , that s true , from my point of view bus is not so unconfortable .
Many people like going by car , but it pollute a lot more than going by public transort.public transport is cheaper than buying a car or motorbike , it also contamiate less than these .
Public transport is also used by childrens like me who want to go to school , high school or to the univerity .
Finally , I think public transport has a very good future , because it has very good advantages but also some little disadvantages , it 's also very usefull for some people .
In my opinion public transport souldn't dissapear .
I like to spend time cute little kids and cooking is my favourite hobby .
In the evening I would like to spend some time with those kids by organising some indoor and outdoor games for them .
I would feel more energtic throughout the day If I have some busy or tight scheduled work , I have come across your advertisement For this job and I really think that I would suit this job in every aspect because I have a friendly move with people in and around me . I would be pleased to know for your positive reply .
My town tries to take care of the environment but sometimes it is not possible .
Some people do n't have any conscience of the need of good environment .
Neither they do n't seem to take care nature and all around it .
For instance , My town have a lot of mountains with big forests , tall trees and many types of animals or plants .
However , that is n't protected by government and its institutions .
Local Parliament haven't regulated principles or rules of the environment , then ecosystems have been destroyed , rivers are contaminate and pollution had reised inside my town .
Besides , my town 's institutions have allowed that some foreign enterprises or corporations could to take our own resources without demand that they be careful with environment .
This is clearly a symptom of how inside my town does n't care any element of the environment .
Nevertheless , in the last decade some neighborhoods have taken conscience on their context .
In this way , we can to see inside them that their population have so much control and they know that affect them .
Good management of the rubbish is a new inclination in many neighborhoods of my town .
Recycle plastic , paper , cardboard etc , by poblation of the most important neighborhoods of my town is a way to improve the environment .
My favourite sport is box because it 's the only sport that can relax me .
In my opinion this sport teaches to mature because in addition to set up the person physically , it instructs the mind .
I begin this sport for 2 years ago .
My brother was win so much fight and when i saw him proud i want to try that .
I do n't know what i can tell .
Thank you goodbye .
Must people prefer large colleges more than small colleges for many advantages .
First , the majors offer numerous and diverse .
It has a lot of faculty members .
It gives the students the freedom to choose his major and the teachers .
In addition , it has a lot of facilities that serve students like kindergarten that takes care of children these employees , university housing , hospital the student of medicine can be application in it and it serves the people too , and a big library has many books in various languages .
Besides that it availability some services like transporting for students and faculty , some restaurants , and mini market .
In addition , the location of large college is clear and the center at the city , so that easily accessible .
In the end , large colleges admit largest number of students , so the student may do establishing friendships more from different nationalities , also it serves the community by graduating many students in various majors .
Once upon a time there was a boy his name is Michael .
He had a very beautiful brown hair , Green eyes , and perfect smile .
Michael loves to play football all the time .
Someday he woke up early at the morning he go out for playing football before school , when he 's playing he saw something running very fast and go away .
He 's back home for getting ready for school when he 's try to forget what he saw , but he ca n't .
after school he did n't go to his home directly to check if what he saw at the morning was real or not , but he did n't find anything .
Next day he woke up early too not to play football but to take a look if this stranger will come back this morning . and he saw it again .
he jump from his bed to the street and walk to his way to see what he did every morning.when he walk after the stranger man he notice that he stopped in every trash in the street to take a look and go to the next one , and guess what he saw Michael and run away also Michael was afraid .
The stranger was looking for a food in the street to take it to his family .
Hi Michael ,
I just got back from a school trip to London .
It was very cool .
we visited the Tower of London , Buckingham Palace and the wax museum .
I liked the most in a wax museum .
He puts them on Marie Tussaud in 1835 .
There are statues of famous people from different walks of life made of wax . when you were last on a school trip ? where it was and what you have seen ?
Hello John

My favorite sport is basketball .
I like it very much .
Almost each weekend , I 'll go to the playground to play basketball with my classmates .
And that 's my happiest time .
Further more , I watch TV of NBA matches each day .
I am quite interested with how the stars are going on .
Insufficient ESP teaching skills made teachers pull back to general English .
This becomes the concern of the employers since it may impact on the students ' learning outcomes .
This should also become the ED UMM commitment .
FILM : LUCY ( 2014 )
TThe plot of this film is about a 25 naive woman that was living and studying in Taiwan and one night went out for clubbing and met a nutter guy that involved her in a seedy drug smuggling issue with a Corean criminal band that forced her to be a mule drug .
A new substance , called CPH4 , bound to be distributed around Europe and the United States by which plenty bag was set into her stomach having an illegal clinical surgery .
But everything became out of control for the criminals when one of her captors kicked on her abdomen , the substance spilles through her body and she begins to experience a different state of consciousness in which she dizzily enhanced her IQ from 2% to almost 100% of his capacity .
During this time she contacts Samuel Norma , PhD Professor of University , to ask him what happens if a person reaches the 100% of his mental activity or IQ .
She 'll end up knowing the answer .
It is a gripping film , starring by Scarlett Johanson and Morgan Freeman in a quite good playing , that will you keep tense until the last scene and does n't leave you feel unpasible .
Nowadays people are using own cars instead of public transport , this effect is more obvious in big cities where the price of public transport cost more than small cities .
Pople are getting used to drive with their own car , it provides more confortability , and is more practical .
You can use it whenever you want , and it 's not necessary make a long queues at metro or bus stations .
The government are opposing to invest in public infraestructures , because the benefits are lower every year .
They are preferring to invest in public roads and motorways .
The impact of this fact has a huge consequences in the climate effect , in the futre the global pollution will increase according to the level of the cars .
The travelling by car it 's very bad .
With the public transport we protected the environment .
The pollutes it 's a global problem .
If we will travel by car have more pollutes that with public transport .
Otherwise , the public transport pollutes less that the car but the car it 's very comfortable and not be hour hard .
With the car I feel more free as I do n't depend to other people for move to the site .
I believe that in the future all transport will be with the public transport or least with massive transport .
The actual system is not possible stand long time .
Recently I saw the trailer of the film about vampires .
The film is called ' The Vampire Diaries ' .
It is about two men and one woman .
The girl is 18 years old and men ( as it later turns out ) are vampires and they have over 100 years .
One of vampires decides to return to high school .
There he meets a girl .
He falls in love in her .
They are together .
Then there is the older brother of the boy ( vampire ) and also falls in love in her .
All the action takes place in Mystic Falls .
This trailer I like and I think that the film would be cool .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He had to buy a present for his girlfriend 's birthday but it was Sunday and all stores were closed so he had to found a solution .
A few hours , he was walking by a garden , and suddenly , he saw the most beautiful flowers that he has ever seen , so he picked them up .
However , flowers were n't enough so he decided to think in anything else .
Several hours later , he found an open sweet shop and he bought some bonbons for her .
Finally , he had found the present and before the end of the day he ran quickly to his girlfriend 's house .
If you do n't want to pass this situation , you must always do things with time .
In my thougths , i have the opinion the public transport is better to the enviroment because going in the public transport reduce the CO2 emissions and take out traffic from the streets .
Reducing the rush hours in the main hours cause a CO2 reduction in the air .
it is a true statement about cars , travelling by car is so much more convenient and the new tecnologies apply to the
People should take less fast food and do regular exercises for maintaining a hgealthy life .
People tend to pick the junk foods as they do not get enough time for cooking at home .
Many of us do not get enough time in the morning , to prepare our lunch for the office .
Easy availability is also tempting us for fast foods .
University education is good for the students but they also need to learn industry specific skills .
Students , for example learn many theories , which may not be required at their place of work .
New skills like analytics and data management are in demand .
In my opinion , what is expected is a new role for teachers but not their disappearance from classrooms .
At university level , availability of IT training , software and manuals provide an ever accessible source of information , that otherwise would not be at hand .
For example , India has high rate of unemployment , hunger , poverty which leads to an immense embrassment of being Indian .
Nowadays internet represents the whole knowledge that people have collected over the centures .
So it provides a lot of interesting information , one of which are about how works different machines what can be found at www.howstuffworks.com .
Also ' internet ' in our days helps to get information all over the world , and if you wish to get involved then go to the www.bbc.co.uk.These sites are free way to find most adequate information about actual events both in society and technical life .
One day i decide o buy news paper .
When i was arrived at home , i was started to read the news paper , so i found from there The International Student Magazine have to organize a short story competition , and I decide to call Michael to tell him about this contest .
Michael was told me he was knew about this contest and at that moment he want to call me to ask , if I am able to came with him at that contest .
After I decided to go with him at the contest , I was thinking to go at that contest next year to participate and win that contest , so this year I was wondering how is the program .
When we were arrived there , the emotions started to appear so definitely it was time to drink a hot coffee , before the contest is started .
I was wondering if Michael pass that exam .
I was waiting for Michael less then an hour , so I started to have a lot of emotions .
After Michael was opened the door from the classroom , I was saw in his eyes something strange .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
The doorbell rang .
When I opened the door imagine my surprised by what I saw .
It was awesome !
One Direction was in front of my door !
I could n't believe in my eyes ...
It was weird that Niall was missing .
Then , I asked them why he was n't with them and they told me : " We are on our tour in America and were singing at our concert in New York City .
When we came back in our dressing room , " Golem " waited for us .
" Golem " as we all know , are magical creatures , made from mud and having black rocks for the eyes , which can be brought to life by a incantation .
So , we were trying to save time until we managed to escape , but Niall did n't make it to escape , as they caught him when he stumbled and fell down .
Now , " Golem " hold him hostage in their cave , which is hidden somewhere in Los Angeles . "
I looked at them trying to think of something to do and then I said : " Come on boys , WE are going to SAVE Niall ! ! ! ! "
We took all we needed and started the searching for Niall ... We went in all caves in Los Angeles , but we could n't found them .
One night , which we were sleeping in our car , by mistake the car started to move and we woke up in a huge cave , out of Los Angeles .
I could n't believe in my eyes , we found Niall .
Then , we got out of our car and save Niall , after we were fighting with " Golem " and came back home .
Recently , an increasing number of people try to travel by car for convenient .
In my opinion , public transport will still exist in the society .
There are three main reasons for supporting my idea .
Firstly , for the long - distance , the car is not as convenient as airport .
for example , if you go to another city by car , you may spent more than two days on the way .
On the contrary , airport just cost your two hours , and you can go to your destination .
The time spending of taking airport is lower than taking car .
Secondly , consuming car is not a normal thing for part of developing or undeveloped country .
The fee of buying car and fuel oil is expensive for poor people .
Thus , it is important to use public transport because it is much cheaper than private car , and everyone can consume .
Thirdly , the global warming is a serious issue for human who live in the earth .
Air pollution is the main causes for global warming .
The great number of using private car leads to higher level of air pollution , and the public transport is one of the best solutions for decreasing the air pollution .
To sum up , there are numerous benefits to use public transport , and it will not disappear .
Nowadays public transportation is included almost all around the planet , We can admit that the transport revolution has been plave in the last century but due to the globalization and technological development , the transport sector is always in a continuos transformation :
In the other hand we must remarque how the plane sector has been grown , currently is the most common way of transport for going away and that 's also means than the shipping factory has decreaced deeply , in order to let the plane market blomm .
Talking about local transport , we have a lot of choisses like cars , motorbikes , busses , train but also as we were talking about , planes .
According to the information donne , the most used is the car thus most of the families has one , but the public transportation is getting more and more common for those ones who want to preserv the planet and develop other alternatives more respectfully with the planet .
As we were talking , the new ecological movement is every time more powerful and charismatic , due to that , bikes are also increasing their role in the new age , there are also linked to the new fashion way to be hipster .
In conclusion , we are assisting to a new tend in transport , every time , they are faster and more developer , with the latest technology included but at the oppossite case , we find also a contradiction , as we found an other trend for the tradictional transport which avoid the pollution in order to respect the Earth
I agree that communiting by car is easier and faster than most of the public transportation ; however , there are serious problems come after it ; the amount of vehicles on the roads keep increase and make congestion and pollution which are far more severe than the inconvenience causing by public transportation .
Thus , I think the future for public transportation will be more proferous .
Dear Jo
Many thanks for your message ,
when you can , you call me .
Then if you want we could go to the restaurant of the city
later if you want we could fiand a job for three months , in my opinion a good job for three months I could be the waiter because the waiter get much money in the three months of the summer .
also I believe that a good job could be lifeguard , because in summer the people go to the beach and they need lifeguard .
If I were you I would choose lifeguard because the lifeguard earn much money than the waiters .
If you want we could go to the capital city of my country , we will go by the car because the car is cheaper than the bus or train , we could eat in the famous restaurant of the city or we could go to the cinema also if you want I could visit the medieval wall .
I am looking forward to see you
best wishes

Mobile phones are most important thing in our daily lifeis the most effective method for instantaneous communication .
However the extensive use of mobiles create lot of problems .
This essay evaluates whether its demerits outweigh its merits .
To begin with now a days people are addicted to mobiles.for example young people wasting their valuable time in mobiles .
Moreover their concentration is reduced .
Another serious problem is people are creating relationships with an unknown person and can leads to several issues including crimes .
To sum up let people aware about the drawbacks of phones and use it wisely .
Uncertain future for Public Transport
Public transport is generally is the transport system provided by government for the general people .
These transport includes buses , trains & boats etc .
People of all classes can use this .
This facility helps the general people in saving their money because usually these transport are the less costly .
My favourite kind of sport is horse riding .
The first time when I ride on the horse I was 14 and since that time I enjoy it very much .
When I ride on the horse I feel myself much better and forget all of my problems .
Riding the horse gives me a state of freedom .
I think that the horse is a kind and clever animal .
If you want to start to ride on a horse , the main thing that you should know is " do n't be afraid of horses ! "
They feel your fear .
Alcoholism is a disease that affects many people in the world today .
I think that is an important illness because it affects the family of alcoholic people .
Moreover , the alcoholics should go to the doctor in order to getting well .
In conclusion , alcoholism is a serious problem for all the society .
I 'm a big fan of science fiction movies , however this kind of movies is actually sometimes a little bad , but in the last weeks a new one has been released , and I was absolutely surprised about this one .
Interstellar is a new Christopher Nolan 's movie which includes the participation of some Hollywood 's stars such as Matthew McConaughey , Anne Hathaway and Matt Damon .
public transport has a big role in transportation specially in large cities like Capital city of countries , using the car some times causes traffic jam if all person uses their own car , to avoid this a good roadways is needed , also the cost of public transportation is lower than private transportation .
on the other hand , public transportation takes more time to get to the required station , because already public transport taking long path to go across more places and as more as peoples take benefits from it , and public transport usually crowed and do not be on time .
for that reason using own car is more comfortable than public transport , you can travel when ever you like and where ever you want .
finally , in the near future most peoples will be using their own car , because it saves much time as comparing with public transport and time factor will be more expensive in the future .
On school days , I get up at 5 a.m. and go jogging in my neighbourhood in 15 minutes .
Then I take a shower , have breakfast with my family members .
Everyone is in a hurry .
I leave home at 7:30 to take a school bus .
After school , I keep running on a track field to be an athlete on a school sports team .
In the rainy season , it is boring to do rehearsals as nobody is on the field .
I come back home on the sunset .
Sometimes , I am exhausted due to a hard workout .
However , I ca n't go to bed early because I have to prepare my homework for tomorrow 's school .
My favourite day it is Saturday because I do not need work or study , so I can go out with my friends and on Sunday I can wake up very late

my favorite sport is basketball .
it is amazing sport .
when i jump to throw the ball in the basket , i feel that i am flying .
when i ran with the ball , i feel that i hold a goal or a valuable something and i should offer my best to put it in his place and make it in right way .
i know that i am not professional player and i am n't belong to any team but i like this game .basketball is so simple play but it is need Speed , concentration and The ability to determine the distances , it contains of two team of five player and each team try to get a high point by throwing the ball through the basket .
What I like most in this game is that The fewest number of player can play it even two player , i recommend everyone to exert it especially with their friends or families ,
In this episode of my life I will to talk you about my daily routine .
I wake up early like 7 am , at this moment go out to the backyard to turn on the boiler , then go to kitchen
Nowadays , people live in very modern and fast society and try to have as convenient life as it is possible .
One of the many possibilities , how do our lives more convenient is to use cars rather than public transport .
Firstly , I like to mentioned public transport 's types .
The most common are bus and train , but in the cities people can use tram , subway or boat and for the long distance they can take a flight .
From my point of view , the main transport disadvantages , which caused our lives discomfort are time and place limitation , sharing the space with others , lack of free seat .
On the other hand , people should think of the environment , pollution , global warming , which all are currently warning .
We should think of our better future and try to behave environmentally friendly - try to avoid the huge pollution , which is by cars caused and do n't think only to our comfort .
In my birthday 's day , I directed go to school this morning . I wonder whether my birthday passed it at lunch time .

After finish to the home , due to I was so tired that I fell asleep and fell down .
The next day , I was reluctanted to rise and class .
Suddenly , I thought of my gift was gone in the class , the students said he / she did n't take , but I doubt them , so we quarrel .
I came home from school , only to found a gift on the sofa .
Ioffer an apology out of harm students , but fortunately he did n't got angry for me .

Hi Peter !
Personally , I agree with your parents .
I think you should save money for the future , because you may have to buy something importantwith your own money .
In my opinion , there are more important things than computer games , so spending money for them it 's like wasting money .
In the future you 'll have to spend a lot of money for the university , the new home and so on , and I think you should start saving money . I should do it too but it 's not simple , actually .
Everything seems so beautiful in the shops !
Silvia .
Actually , where I live the public transport is highly used , It seems that in the near future they wo n't disappear .
In fact in some countries overdeveloped may will extinguish because I suppose travelling by car is much cheaper and faster .
But , that future is very far for our actual situation .
Collecting book is my favourite pastime .
I started my hobby when I was a chid .
The first item in my collection is ABC book .
And now , I have a lot of books of all kinds : biology , chemistry , novel , dictionary , etc .
Now I have about 100 and more in future , I hope that .
Whenever I find an interesting book I buy it immediately .
Sometimes , my family and my friends gives me book such gifts .
I classify them into different categories : manual , cookbook , biography , etc .
It takes all my spare time to clean and dust .
It keeps me amused for hours , too .
This is the first text I would like to write on this website . I think this is a good idea to contribute to English language research and improve my skill at the same time .
As this is my first time , I would like to find out how exactly does the system work , so I chose to write this random text rather than those serious topics available .
Public transport is more convenient than cars , many ways.when we use public transport that benefits many ways .
Maintaing cars are expensive .
Public transport you do not need to worry about any petrol filling , checking tyre pressures , getting tired after driving long journey .
In future cutting down public transport affects many of the people .
Elderly people wo nt able to drive always depends on public transport .
If public transport stop services people who are not able to drive will affect a lot .
Travelling by car is convenient but there are dis advantage as well .
As our population growing fast in a family both husband and wife working and children at university able to drive , so you are looking per house least 3 cars , so imagine how busy our roads will be .
As now fuel price coming down that does not mean that it will stay like that for ever , price go up and down .
In summary public transport is important for our community and people has to raise their concerns regarding this .
Stopping public transport not going to gain anything rather than impact will be unpredictable .
Due to increased traffic may cause delays in arranged journeys , increase the number of accidents ... etc .
I think sport is a good exercise for need to exercise people , I have a suggestion that want to have good health , choose a interest sport and try to play it , let it be a regular thing , it 's will be fun and health your physical constitution .

Does basketball have the fame that is deserves ?
Nowadays basketball is the sport which rules in the USA .
90% of the Americans wants to be a basketball star , with the dream of playing with Lebron James , Pau Gasol , Marc Gasol ...
According to the results of a questionnarie ( Houston habitants)and most of them , play basketball to forget the homework , problems and to relax in their free time .
Also they think that the main reason for their preference instead of other sport which is more intense .
However they think that basketball is only a reason to meet all the family , friends ...
Furthermore , they give advice to those all novice on basketball " do n't ever lost the passion " if because they give up , they wo nt play with the biggest players of the wolrd .
In conclusion , the real objective of the questionnarie consist on what the people think about the king sport of United States of America .

I think one of my favorites sports of all is the atletism I love it because it is a sport where you prove yourself , you have to be every day better than you where yesterday , it force you to improve every time , also is an exercise that help all your body , especially the legs because it gives them great strength , but also your hands because they have to be in a constant movement , and all the body in general because you run and your metabolism is accommodated and help you to have coordination .
I enjoy running a lot because it relax me , I let out all my worries and frustrations , so it makes me happy .
I recommended all the people who wants to run that if you do n't feel like you 're improving anyway keep going and whit the time you will see results .
I am not sure that mines is the best family in the world but I am pretty sure that I have the best parents I could never wished for .
There is my mother , my father , my two brothers and me .
I am the biggest of the children , than after me is my brother Sidi .
Sidi has 24 years old and at least is Joni , who has only 15 years old .
Generally I miss them all because I live in a distant city away from where my family lives now .
I used to live with them for 25 years a Genoa but last year I left home because I found a job in Milan , which is the city where I actually live now .
Thank you for your attention .
This is an introduction for how to make bank notes .
The first two step is to design with background color artwork and security issues and prepare metal plates with skilled machinists .
Then there are some requirments for printing sheets : color on both sides , special ink and images slightly raised .
The most essential and key process is manual inspections for printed sheets with three categories : good quality sheets , patially damaged sheets and bad sheets .
The qualified and nit damaged severely sheetes are supposed to be packagd and distribued , which will be cut into separate bank notes , packed and then dispatched .
On contrary , other failed sheetes will be disposal and destroyed with band notes in a secure way .
Once upon a time a boy was six years old .
His name was Michael .
Michael lived in a big house in Denton , Texas .
He had a lot of animals : Two dogs and three puppies , four horses , eigth ducks and one cat , Lionel .
Lionel was a black and white cat , and it was a very funny , fast and sweet aminal .
It was the prefer of Michael .
Lionel was the best friend of Michael .
When Lionel was around Michael , the boy was happy .
One day , Michael got up late , and he had going to school at seven o'clock .
It was Six o'clock and he had hurry if he would not want to get to school late .
Michael had breakfast and he forgot to prepare milk for Lionel .
Michael was out all day , and Lionel has not anything for eating ....
Michel closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
When I was a little girl I used to play volleyboll and I really liked that .
One day I had a surprise , I have met a teacher and he invited me to tranee in a huge gym in a team .
I started to think that was born for that sport .
I worked too hard , but enjoe playing really .
Sundully happanned sonething , I need to work to play my studuies in the High school , so the life changes anyway , I needed to stop my favourite sport , because I should need to study in that moment it was more important for me .
Today I do not play volleyboll anymore , but I really enjoy dancing , now I can say that it is my favourite , it is all of .
The line graph shows the U.S. cigarette price in dollar related to cigarette consumption in billions of packs from 1970 to 2006 .
The hugest gab is in 1981 where is the cheapest price combined to the highest expanditure of cigarette packs in the whole interval .
Roughly in 1998 we can notice an equibrium price at 2,75 $ and an equibrium quantity at 23 billions of packs .
Later both lines changed their regular trends so there are an huge imbalance again .
My English is great level and speaking is my favourite part of learning English .
Captain at sports is what I did in high school .
I am very pleased to help organise sports activities .
World is progressing rapidly , day by day there is a new ways of transportation , there is a new technology .
From the beginning of the world till now , human wants the fast income and the easy ways of live , so he tries more and more to find a solution for his problems by creating a new ways of liveing more easy and more convenient for him .
So that , transportation was one of the most important issues faced human , because it is related to the interaction between people like trading and many other purposes .
From this point every human have the ability to buy a car and also buy his rest he will not hesitate to do it .
It is claimed thatour lives will improve in the next fifty years .
But we do n't if this change would be good or bad , I hope that will be good but let 's talk about it .
Fistly , i 'd like to talk about employments , i think that these are the most important thing to worry about , if our studies get better , we will create more employments and as a result the economical situation of the country will be better .
Moreover , our capacity fosr learning more lenguages seems to be really adequate unfourtunatelly while there are a lot of teenagers that are getting prepared really hard , there are others that are all the opposite .
I think it is probable that in some years the tecnology could have improve quite a lote , and this is a very powerful advantage for us , the young people .
Beacuse we were borned in ' the internet generation ' as everyone says , so this aspect might be helpful for us .
In conclution , i 've got to said that now we do n't have to worry about the future we just have to carry on in present and do it the better we can .
Hi Alex!h How are you ? I heard that you went out with Mike !
It 's a fantastic new !
Anyway , I was guessing if you want to go to the cinema with me to see the new Leonardo Dicaprio 's movie because I heard that action movies are your favourites .
My favourite kind of movie is horror , actually my favourite movie is " The orphan " .
It talks about a little girl who went adopted but she is 35 years old in reality .
It is very creepy !
Anyway , I hope that you come with me to the cinema .
See you soon .

Nowadays the public transport system are running out of passengers due to heavy use of personal transport such as cars and bikes.in early 1990 the public transport systems were most popular trans port system across the world because , most of the peoples had not their own vehicle . but in late 1990 most of the people were able to buy their own vehicle due to many financial institute which has various loan facilities .
today many people use their own vehicle for instead of public transport , the other thing is , it is easy and convenient way to travel to the job and any other personal work . therefore , it can be seen the demand for public transport getting low and lover .
In conclusion , it is true that the demand for the public going down rapidly as thy have their own vehicles .
however , even though everybody has their own vehicles they will have to use public transport once the roads are full of vehicles .
I have seen the following announcement in International Sport Monthly magazine .
My favourite sport is football , and I enjoy because I love football players .
I had the opportunity to meet more about this sport .
I would advise you to the person starting the sport endeavor and can fulfill their dream , many ca n't get what they accomplished those players today are very famous
You can learn with your referee and with coach .
Some people prefer play together but also there competition between players .
People 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
I think that this class discussion could n't true .
In the future people 's live had better .
Providing that we care the environment .
It 's really important .
If we live well , we will be more carefully with world .
Otherwise everybody wanted a future better .
Nowadays there are a lot of things that we doing the live easier .
In order that if I were you , I would live well in the next 50 years .
I 'm looking forward so people will have more interesting by this case .
For instance , my family do n't think that will happened in the next 10 years .
They live at the moment .
Besides they said that in all the moment : ' Carpe diem ' .
This is other opinion .
I 'm Emad from Egypt .
my family consists of 5 members - my father , my mother and tow brothers .
my father is a business man .
he is 65 years old .
he works in real state investment .
my mother is a teacher .
she is 50 years old .
she is working in primary school .
my older brother is 30 years old and he is working as accountant for radio and television union in Cairo .
the younger brother is 25 years old .
he is a dentist .
he is doing master in turkey these days .
the last member is me , I 'm Aeronautical engineer in Qatar .
I love my family but everybody staying and living in different place or country .
the best brother for me is the second one who is a dentist .
he is my best friend and brother .
I hope if I can living with him in the same place .
he is very helpful and collaborator .
we spent a fun time in the beginning of our life when we were kids .
I really love my mother and father .
they spent their life helping us to be good men .
my older brother helped us in studying , but he is older than me by 10 years , so the relation between us is n't strong .
Anyway i 'm very happy to write for you .
This assertive is totally false .
The expansion of public transport is one of the keys saving the planet , especially if the energy source used come from clean sources .
Nowadays , the use of vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel is the main cause of air pollution in big cities around the world . Researches show that the private cars are used most often carrying few person at a time , what makes it very inefficient considering the quantity of carbon dioxide and other toxic substances expelled to the environment each time that the engine is started .
Lady decided to visit her boyfriend .
But she is boyfriend live upstate and hasn't got a airport he 's of city because of that she was need choose by train .
She was just prepared a suitcase after that went to train station .
In my opinion I think that the increase of teenage crime is because their parents do not put limits to them , and how not pay attention , they make all kinds of serious mistakes .
From my point of view , the best thing the police can do with these people is send them to a reformatory until they can leave disciplined .
Another good option is give them a difficult work for every day keep them busy , but I do n't know what kind of job can be , because a person who commit a crime is n't going to do something to help society like communitarian service .
I felt nervous when the phone rang .
I was sitting calmly ina cafe , when I heard it ringing .
Firstly I thought
it could be one of my best friends as we really liked to have lunch together .
But I saw unknown phone number on a display and felt a little bit nervous .
What if it were my boss or clients and possibly something dreadful had happened to my job .
It went on ringing and with great fear I clicked on the green button .
Luckily it was my colleague Jane who wanted to drink a cp of fresh coffee with me .
The flowchat provides an overview of the steps of making bank notes , it shows that how bank notes are manufacted from designing to thing we can used .
This process involves five main stages .
First , it should take some considerations in design , including background colour , artwork , security issues .
Next , skilled machinists is prepared , in which there are metal plates .
Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet).Subsequently , the technical must be used specially for distinction , for example the colour printed on both sides , Special ink is used and imges slightly raised .
After this , printed sheets will be inspected carefully .
According to the quality of sheets , it will be two results.if the quality is good or the bank notes is partially damaged which can be used , it would cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and disoatched.while those bad sheets will be securely destroyed .

when you talk with someone have you ever thought in your words before you say it ?
a lot of us never think before they speak and that is not good thing to do .
you must think a little bit before you talk as one word causes a lot of pain for others for the rest they lives .you may not actually notice that but you will feel what am really mean if someone tells you a painful words .
it is clear that everyone is ought to make a mistake without even noticing .
for example a kid named Michael .
Michael is a good boy and he always listen to his mother .on time Michael was very angry as he got a bad score in his test .when he was home his mother was cooking she asked him what is the wrong ?
he said bad words that he will regret saying these words .he went to his room .Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Dear friend ,
It was great to hear from you again .
In your last email you told me about your lack of time of enjoying your hobbies .
I can understand how difficult this decision must be .
However , if I were you , I would do what I have always want .
And I know which matter you 've always been interested : music .
I remember when you told me once you was playing a violin for four hours .
So , a good idea would be to keep yourself doing creative things .
Anyway , you could always do any sport in your extra - free time .
As it 's often said : a good body makes a good mind .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you again .
Tell me what you decide .
Love ,
Anabel
I do n't like the public transport of school .
It is slow , inefficient and dangerous .
I prefer travel in the car or motorbike , i am feeling security .
In my family travel in the taxi , because the taxi is fast and secure .
Today I felt bad in the public transport .
It was solwly .
Also i can see the air pollution is tallest .
Compared car or bus , the car is the most expensive than bus , because the car is comfortable and faster .
The taxi so it is .
In the morning , I go to the school in bus with my brothers but they get out earliest .
I prefer travel in the car .
once upon the time there was a little man called Michael , that man has a heart of a little child and the brave of big man .
he had a girlfriend called sinha who was a girl with a big heart but unfortunately broken one .
one day Michael decided to make a surprise party to sinha to make her happy and feel his love more so he arranged everything and to keep it surprise to her he was busy all the time and did not show off all the week as usual .that make sinha worried and suspect that Michael do not love her any more and know another girl and she become extremely sad and even it become worse when Michael asked her to go to his apartment to make the surprise to her but he did not answer his phone after that .
when he come she start crying and thought he would break up with her and she did not give him a chance to talk or explain anything she started to cry louder and accused him of cheating that make michael astonished how she did not trust in him , how she thought that about him and he told her that he can not stand that anymore he would break up with her and he left .Michael close the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake
There 's no discussion which is my favourite restaurant in town , The Seaside . I will tell you why and also why it 's so appropriate for us , as a class to take our last farewell there .
Our class has reformed over the years , with great classmates leaving and coming we have always been welcoming about it , and not at least towards the new ones .
It 's not necessarily to be nice and keen to everyone but our class actually is , in the weekends the whole class gather in different events together .
I think the welcoming process in the beginning is crucial for this fellowship we have today and probably in 10 years too .
What I just told is what the restaurant Seaside means to me . Welcoming .
Fellowship .
At the Seaside 's you are genuinely welcomed at the first doorstep , they accept you whoever you are .
This makes th
It all started in the Parson Institute in the class of art history students of the race of Fine Arts in the class the teacher in charge , Jimena , commissioned a task to his students , saying :
-To Begin with this course , I want to be sure they know the meaning of art , pro I want it translated into a sculpture or painting made by yourselves , without any specific technique , only your imagination , with it you explain to me what it is art .
His excited students began coming to their homes with such work , since they had only 4 days to perform their duties .
After 4 days all came with spectacular pictures , portraits of people , large sculptures , to a student , her name was Sandra , she arrived with a piece of crumpled paper , old in which only had a name written in a style different letter , only there reflected , exposing the moment everyone laughed at her for her work , but the teacher said :
Art is complex , and seeing that everyone laughed with the work of his partner , can see that nobody understood the real meaning , since art is different for each person , each creates a different definition , so we must respect each of them understand that each person is a different world and everyone is art .
A student that really moved him , and reflect so apologetic , and out of the room , closed the door and Michael knew then that he had made a mistake .
In fact , this topic is very important in our modern times .
my favorite sport it affects me greatly.i'm a kung - fu player .
this sport is my favorite , but sometimes I think about to leave this sport . because in later time I hate a blood , so I think a lot of time to leave this sport . but it is dominated to me .
it 's makes me likes an animal when i 'm standing and get ready to fight i 'm convert into enemy.i'm a fucking ghost and I can kill anyone who tried to stop me .
so , i 'm rely thinking left this sport .
Everyday i get up early and exercise in the garden with my friends.i'm exercising more and more again to improve myself and become the best fighter in the world.i'm champion in my sport so , i 'm seek to do all my effort to be the first one in the world.finally I did not find encourage of my family or my teachers .
Hello to every body ! !
Now I 'm going to talk about the benefits o learning another language .
I am from spain so my foreign language is Spanish
I start to study another language when I was a child , I started learning English because every one said that English is the future language , when I finished my school time I tried to study French but it was so difficult for me .
I have to say that study another language give you more opportunities because on these days you need to now other language to look for a work and be more inteligent than your college to take the work and that 's great .
And to day is necessary because if you want to travel around the world and meet people and have conversation with their you need to now more than your foreign language , because in the rest of the world and particularly in Europe people now more than two language and that great .
I think learning other language never have drawbacks because all you learn is good for you and your main , you never stop to now new things .
These days , most of the people feel comfortable to travel through car and then they believe that public transport is not going to be sustain for longer time .
However I do not agree with them because in most part of the world mass transport system is still popular and they are environment friendly and cost efficient .
Firstly , Public bus service is very popular in most part of the world .
In most part of the Europe , people still prefer public bus instead of car to travel .
Secondly , public transport are environmentally sound in comparison to private vehicle .
It carries more people while private vehicle carries fewer people .
Public bus do not let more cars to contaminate environment .
Finally , Public transport 's cost efficient .
People need to spend more money on fuel if they want to travel same destination by private vehicle .
In conclusion , although car is convenient to travel , it is not enough to finish the future of public transportation .
In the towns of the future , the care of the environment is one of the most important thing .
People have conciencied themselves that we need to respect the nature and the human places where we live .
Human beings have destroyed our environment along the time and now , the earth is in danger .
First place we need to care about is our near place , the town .
I like to take out the trash every night and I try to recycle my trash throwing it in different bags .
I have recently bought an electric car in sustitution of my traditional car .
An electric car is less harmful for the environment .
When I go out to the camp , if I lunch there , I take care of cleaning the ground .
I like nor the dirty people neither the dirty places .
I hope to live in the future in a clean town and I 'm sure that the most of the people are now thinking in this way . We need to care of our town because nobody like to place into a dump .
Military service is the military training which needs people have to join army or voluntary for a period of time .
In Korean , people should completed military service at least 2 years .
Similarly , people have to join it 1 year in Taiwan .
It is a debate that should everyone have to complete military service when they reach 18 years old .
With supporters maintaining that it is important for national security and make people maturity , whilst opponents claim that the military service have effects on study and should have freedom of choice .
Firstly , every countries acquire stabilization must be protected by a stronger armed forces for national security .
If the war or other dangerous threat the safety of country , they can not get help from other countries immediately .
Therefore , people accept military service could be easier to protect their country .
Especially some small population of country have policy that is people need join military service due to develop into a powerful country .
Secondly , the important for people become maturity when they completed military service , which probably is a particular experience for 18 years old .
In addition to have hard physical training and get different special skills , people also can improve personal quality in military service .
Consequently , people could be more independent and strong , they seems to earlier become mature than other people who do not completed military service .
In contrast , opponents of military service point out that study is the first vital thing for people who reach 18 years old .
Military service mainly to improve physical , however study might be completed better in school at the age because it has professional teacher team and a good study atmosphere , people usually easier to concentrate on learning knowledge .
For instance , some countries allowed people join military service after their all courses was finished .
Additionally , critics argue that countries are able to allow people have freedom of choice for military service .
Relatively some people unwilling join military service , people volunteered in a military service possibly enjoy it .
Furthermore , it also can respect for right s of people , especially for women who do not can adapt the hard training .
In conclusion , it can be concluded that military service is necessary for national security and good for people improve themselves .
The best course of action would be government attempt to allow people volunteered in conscription when they completed their studies .

I live in a small city in the middle of Vietnam .
This city do n't have a lot of citizen but It 's a travel city .
So in the street always have a lot of trash cans .
It will help people not throw the garbage in the street .
In our city have a billboard to urge people to have attention to environment .
In the school set up a workshop to tell with students important environment to our live .
The citizen of the city want to build the city with the slogan " The city green - clean - beautiful " .
So they have aware to keep the city reach that .
So everyone bring the trash to the place permission .
Every year have " earth hour " .
In this hour , many people turn off the light in their house to save energy and protect environment .
I am very proud about the awareness from my city people .
I wish have a lot of people around the world see the important of environment .
And they have act to protect it .
I was in a museum of New York looking at all the beautiful paintings and sculptures , when I hear the alarm of the museum everyone was afraid including me .
The police was chasing the bandit that stole a painting , but he escaped instantly .
The police let all the people go .
I went to my apartment and turn on my TV and I watch in the news that the bandit escaped with 3 paintings .
I decided to solve the case .
I went to the museum and follow all the tracks that I found were a broken sculpture .
I search for any clue and I found something , it was a piece of paper with an address on it .
I follow the address and when I get there it appears to be an abandon house .
I decided to wait , and hide on the bushes if I see someone entering .
In the night I see a shadow entering the house .
I carefully approached the window of the house and I see two men with the paintings .
They left the house on a truck .
I follow them in a taxi .
We were on the terminal of New York it was a very famous landmark .
There were a lot of commuters on the terminal so I lost the two men .
I located the instantly because I recognize their hats .
I was focal to them .
They threaten all the people cruelly so all the sightseers were angry with them .
However the modernization of the terminal was unknown to me so I was completely lost .
We entered on a train , the ceiling was comfortable but everyone was objecting of the two men .
When we arrived we were on the other side of the city of New York the features were so common because it was a good economic and conveniently because would attract more tourists .
I finally trap them their names were Lucius Fowley and Bob Parker I tell the police and the police put them on jail .
And the paintings were on the museum again .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do somethig immediately .
Today is a very important day for the sake of his future .
The watch shown the time is 9.30am and 2 hours left before he go to the place that made his heartbeat so fast .
He have an interview for getting the scholarship so that he can pursue his dream to study medical in Ireland .
He went to the station bus to ride on bus .
He took a few minutes for walking to the station bus from his house .
After the bus arrived he ride on and half an hour he arrived to the destination .
When he took a few steps from the bus he saw a very tall building that the interview places located .
After waiting an hour the time comes and bravely with high confident level he walke to the office .
Suddenly his water floaded and tears drop from his eyes .
The interviewer who is sitting infront of him was a person with blue eyes that he really loves .
The situation suddenly changed .
Peter without doubt hugged the intertiewer who is a man about 4o years old .
The man who is crying together with him was his father that have leave peter and his mom because they had divorce 6 years ago .
Then the interview became a meeting between father and a son that really touched .
Killed two birds with a stone is a perfect idiom to describe Peter 's situation because he got his beloved father back and still can pursue his dream to studies in ireland.q

And I need your help with this .
Would you like to improve this course with me ?
Please , writes me a list with the words when I need for technical konversation .
Thank you very much .
Dear Teacher Mary
I am writing to give my opinion of the restaurant " The Crazy Cat " this is a very good restaurant .
first the restaurant have wide variety in his food .
The chef can make the menu of the day to the dinner or you can choose a special menu .
The purpose of the chef is soup and creamed corn to start , beef medallion covered bittersweet of carrot sauce with nuts and the dessert chocolate cake with cheese .
the atmosphere is also very good has music in live with different bands .
you can choose two bands of rock or pop and one dj .
the cost is accessible .
The pack have a cost of $ 350 a person .
Can a TV programme get to entertain and educate at the same time ?
Nowadays , it is the most important challenge for television .
People complaint about how the information about different TV shows do n't contribute in the process of learning , that 's why many of This programmes are considered trash , because of the multiples shows such as realities , talk shows , or showbiz that hardly ever have a good message or something interesting for people .
A good example of this shows are how people are paid to act in realities or talk show where they show exaggerated or hilarious familiar problems , where the only aim is to get more audience .
Another good example are the endless showbiz that are appeared recently , this type of programs where the information is often gossip about personal life of famous singers and actors without taking into count if they are true or not .
It 's a pity to know that exist just a few programs that try to educate people with the most update information through documentaries , investigations , cultural or opinion programs , which in my opinion help to acquire more knowledge .
Knowledge that sometimes are unknown even though it is part of the general culture or proper of the history of our country .
I think in the future do n't exist public transport because we will drive their car .
When you drive your own transport , a car for example , you going to from a specificlly place but in a bus you go to the bus stop and no to your house or school , work ...
It is better from the people be more comfortable because you drive and not the other person . I know some people , the drivers , began haven't got work , but the public transport is free and is free because it is the government pay , this money bacame do to make more work for others .
No all is good some people haven't got money ca n't go to another place to another place and the pollution became more and more , it is a serious problem and the solution is only for the rich people , the solution is buy an electric car , the other solution , more economic , is the government give the money to the population to buy an electric car .
I do n't know what is better no public transport or public transport .
There is no future for public transport since everybody prefer to use their own car .
now time is valuable for every body nobody bothered about money .
traffic is very high in now days so it will be difficult to reach office on time .
public transport is always crowded so it is not comfort to travel
Find your joy in scary movie
I would ignore thriller films due to my fragile heart , but my mind is changed now after watching this film .
The film is entitled " Scary Movie " which is directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans .
This story was shown a murder who completed the mission : killed everyone that he hated .
At last , only one person could be alive even those sacrificed had tried to escape this horrible result .
This is a combined story of horror and comedy .
I can not find a word to describe this film easily , what can I say is you will be regret if you miss this film .
This first reason is all actors shown their talent in this film directly and audience can follow their steps and the story certainly , this essential element which also makes a big success to the film .
Besides , the attractive story line makes a lot of climax so that everyone can finish this film from the beginning to the end and creates the billion box office to this film .
However , I think the tools should be improved , such as killer 's knife and actors'costumes , the knife looks like as brittle as a handicraft , I believe those are seconded - handed clothing . I think this is a pity to this movie .
At last , your bravery can be improved after watching this film .
What are you waiting for ? Go and check it out !

Our teachers are doctors and they are in charge of teach us about work - team , so it 's common that one / two people do all work ... with this I want to say : is rewarding when our teacher ask something and you know the answer because you could study all topic .
I have experience to go to the hospital and was too interesting .
I deal with medicine students who are superior to me , for example , doctors and surgeon .
I only could oversee what they do to obtain visual experience and know how was a surgery .
How learning English
It 's proven that to learn a foreign lengueage you have to go abroad .
You can study hard for years , but if you arent't obligated to use English for things of everyday , you wo n't became good at it .
There are n't other options .
Of course , also studyng in a foreign country has disadvantages .
First , it costs a lot .
Even there are lots of different possibilities and scholarship , not everydoby can allows they .
Living abroad , even though for a short time , it could be very stressful and people can feel homesick .
Despite that , there are more reasons to go studyng away .
It is a very useful experience in many ways .
You will learn better and faster than studying at home .
In addition , visit new countries and meet new cultures , helps to open your mind and to foster a lot .
I did several school trips in the past years and I 'm going to do it again sure .

carbohydrates are essential for a healthy diet .
It provides energy for our bodies .
Nutritionists recommend the quarter of a person 's diet should contain carbohydrates .
When your body takes an insufficient amount of carbohydrates , the protein replaces the lack of carbohydrates to supply the body with energy .
And this will cause diseases on the long run .
Dear reader ,
My name is Andreas Miret and I am 18 years .
I am from Sweden but I have been living in Barcelona since I was young .
Nowadays , I am studying a degree in economics at the University of Barcelona .
I am applaying for the job vacant in the summer camp .
I have some experience working with children aged between 5 and 17 years .
Last year I was working every friday and sunday at a ski camp in la masella .
Also this summer i went to the United States and I was working in a summer camp .
Now our company is going to do multidimensional operation , not just focus on furniture but also for home appliance .
In addition , we will adjust company 's management direction in each department depend on market 's reaction and environment
Like retailer ,
We have sold our products to KA system for few years , however , the products that we sold were usually popular consumer goods , it means cheat and have no enter obstacles for other supplier .
In addition , it is hard to collect money from KA system .
And because we have our own factories and professional machines , we can easily to avoid the price competition .
To make high obstacle furniture , like R - angle wooden cabinet , high gloss cube .
We will search the market demand based on our core products , also produce high quality products .
For the factories , because Chinese demographic dividend are not like before anymore , the low price and undiversified products should become verity and premium goods .
Focus on user experience , inventive , unique and our core products
Therefore , we are reforming and doing high - tech items , likes LED , photoelectric , vacuum , steam mop , etc .
Use this core technology to develop blow machine , air cleaner , iron , etc .
Besides , factories are keeping going on our professional items and service like , high glossy , auto painting and 4-side edge sealing , honeycomb board , etc .
Also for our wire rack , plastic
products .
And still working hard to build our own brand .
Nowadays , people have a lot of afraid about contaminations of Planet .
All governments increasing their politic laws about this topic and also they promoted new rules in the daily life of the population .
One of the new rules about the reduction of contamination in the cities is the transport public .
According to the general world laws about the global world warm , each country has considered its owns arguments about it .
I can give us an example how big cities around the world can reduce more contamination .
London is a good example and Barcelona too .
These cities do n't allow to drive in the centre city , the industry reduces its taxes if it 's increasing the politic nature .
My city is a good example , too .
The town major has offered to population free bus .
It 's a good idea to remove the traffic jam .
I think , in conclusion , all people should have a good behaviour and an open mind and they and myself also to catch more often the public transport .
My country is the best country in the world .
I love it so much .
We have different cultures here , and two main languages , Arabic and Amazigh .
Morocco is a kingdoom , like Spain and England , We have king and princes .
My day in London !
I went to London in the summer .
I liked London , because there are a lot of great things .
On Monday me and my friend Chrissy went to the Big Ben .
we wnet to the Trocadero .
But the best was the Guarda from Bukingham Palace .
chrissy made a funny face but the Guards did n't say anything .
We had very , very good weather .
It was fantastic .
The temperatures was over 20 degrees .
We travelled to London by plane , but to come back we travelled by car abd boat .
After we came back I told my family everything .
Environmental changes really need in the current situation .
People contribuation is very important in this matter .
The report explains how my town people taking care of my surroundings and to preserve this planet in a betterway .
Firstly , hyrid cars only allowed to use during weekends as result of this most people not using there cars all the week .
This attitude reduced enromous amount of smoke pollution from the pipes .
Government policy changes help a lot for water preservation .
Many factories follwing the regulations and not draining the harmful wastage in the water .
Secondly , Closed trash bins provided to the people in order to collect the waste and recycling .
People come forward and utilising this bin effectively instead of throwing away .
As a result of this town looks clean compare to previous decades .
In addtion to that recyclable waste , sell and the money will be given to respective person .
This gives motivation to the public and they can earn by using right way to dispose their waste .
Thirdly , Public toilets has been opened for the public to elminate attitude of urinating in the public places .
Town council not only encourage people to planting or garndening , it subsidise money for their green improvements .
Example , free fertilizers , water pump failitiesand pesticides .
Is summary , people taken many intiative steps and moving forward to have safe and attracticve eniroment surrondings .
My favorite sport is football .
This is a internacional sport because in all parts of world there are persons that they play .
football is a fameous sport you can whatch it on tv or yo can see it on direct.there ara a lot of level categories , the most fameous categorie is the first .
people that they play in this categorie are fameous althoug you can see them on tv.if you want to be a big football player you must to practise more time and yoor life should to be healthy .
you must to care your food and yours habits for you have a healthy body .
this sport is the best of the world and the most fameous annd i think that this is the most enjoyed .
Soccer is the best sport for me because you can get fit , meet other people and participate on competitions .
If you want to start practicing this sport , you should be prepared to work hard .
This is a story from a country where there were no cats .
One day , an elderly foreign lady visited the country with no cats .
She gave the King an adorable kitten which she had brought with her .

The graph given shows the seasonal sales of ice - cream from two places at an Englishl seaside resort from 2012 to 2014 , they are separately an ice - cream van and an indoor public swinmming pool .
As the graph indicates , the sales at ice - cream van was generally larger than that at indoor swimming poor .
For the ice - cream van , it saled most in Jul - Sep each year , nearly reached 5000 dollars and it was still slightly increasing year by year .
In every year , from January to July , the sales slightly increased and reached the peak at the third season , then it gradually slide back to the year 's bottom .
Each year was nearly the same .
For indoor swimming poor , its sales did n't have large changes , usually saled about 2000 - 3000 dollars for each season .
It usually saled most in Apr - Jun and Oct - Dec and slided to the bottom in Jul - Sep .
In general , its sales were falling with the time went by .
There was a nice spring morning .
Both of them were young , beautiful and naive .
She put her cup of coffee on the windowsill , hooked up the brist on her beautiful little breast , put right her colourful light - minded skirt , took her orange scarf and red little handbag and went to the door .
He stood up near the open window , smoked and looked at her without any words .
When she said good - bye , he just nodded .
When she looked at him from under her long eyelashes he turned away and stared at the landscape outside .
When she made step out , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Nowadays we constantly use means of transport to go everywhere so that our lifestyle .
Society depends on them .
We are used to travel by car , in fact each family has one .
Despite , travelling by public transport can be a better option in so many cases .
Certainly cities will be crowded in the future because population is always increasing .
Using your own car to go to the citycentre could be a nightmare , it would be a stressful waste of time .
Ubearable traffic jams and no parking areas would be the main problems .
Besides , the price of petrol is increasing too , and it likely will be as expensive that most people not be able to afford a car .
In contrast , there will be cheaper alternatives as bus , train or even plane for long distances .
In other hand , many drivers enjoy travelling by his vehicle because they like to drive and they feel free .
Finally goberments and society are concerned about the environment and I consider that they will decrease levels of pollution and co2 emitions .
From my point of view public transport will not disappear even if cars are much more comfortable , faster and more evolved than now .
Time is precious .
Every one ca n't deny that time is a big factor in our life .
The life divided to terms of time , we live through time , we grow with time
till Now , we talk in time and finally , we perish after time .
World change by time .
Time never stops and does n't wait anyone .
We must value time . I hope my country to be as a developed countries in using the best use of time .
once moment lost is lost for ever .
it can never be regained even the strongest monarchs have been helpless to prevent time .
So should be careful about the importance of time .I hope to not waste it and use it as the best use for giving opportunity for rising .Those who waste it , will be behind and they will fail to make a mark in their life .
The great men and successful guys became fame and rose by a suitable use for time .They guide and source of inspiration for a new generation .
So , we can say that time is a double - edged sword , either help you or agonist you and in the popular say is right that say " do n't delay the work of this day to the next day " because our works will accumulate then it become more hard to finish it .To ensure best use of time in our life , we need to be punctual.punctuality avoid tension and trouble things , finally even scientists have another vision about time , they discover that time is the fourst dimension by relative theory which exchange all concepts in science .
I ca n't say expect that time more important in our life and we need to save it .
My town is very small .
His name is Santa Marta and he is near Trujillo .
In my town , we can see a big swimming pool , five parks , four bares and one state school .
in my town there are a lot of old people , and there are nor much children , because they love in other cities .
I love my town , because when I was a small girl , I went there , and I was with my grandparents , my cousins and my friends .
my best friend live in madrid , but We always were together in her house or in my house 's grandparents .
I have been very happy , and today I am happy there .

The diagrams below show how bank notes are made through four steps and how bad shees and notes are disposed .
To begin with , the format of the bank notes needs to be designed , factors of considerations including the background colour , the artwork and the security issues .
Sencondly , equipments like skilled machinists as mental plates should be prepareed for the next steps .
Thirdly , print the sheets of bank notes(50 banks notes per sheet)with special ink , where colour is condidered on both sides and images will slightly raised on the bank notes .
Most importantly , manually inspected on each printed sheet in case that there would exist damaged sheets .
Once damaged sheets are discovered , partically separate them into good and bad ones and them burn the bad notes , making sure that the remaining sheets are of good quality .
Good sheets are cut into separate bank notes , then packed and dispatched to other place , comparing with which , the bad ones have to be destroyed securely .
the movie which I have chosen to write about is microphone .
it is An egyption movie acted by khaled aboelnaga and young actors . the actions of this film took place in Alexandrie city of Egypt and it talks about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they did n't have much money to produce their own albums ,
that sort of bands is famous between the youth and they call it " under ground bands " .their songs give a big concenet to the political and social stituation in Egypt and they become famous after the25 january revoulation , why I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society , there is no chance for the youth and if they found it , they face lot of problems to save it and they did n't find time for other activties and in sometimes they worked in thing which they never learn or love
I live in a small city , then there are few things that my town made for the environment : like the recycling , therefore we must know of what is made the material that we throw , and put them in the right dumpster .
This is a little act for us , but if we all contribute will be a big help for the environment .
We also can use appliance that not consume so much , if we can adopt sustainable electric systems or buy organic products .
In the big cities they have began to build green buildings , they use the electricial public transport not to pollute .
In my opinion there may be many rules , but if we do n't respect it , we will not help our habitat .
The most exciting day on my life was May 9th , last year , when I attend the secondary school .
I stayed on France with my friends and my teachers .
I woke up very early .
I catch the bus and I waved my mum .
Then I talked with my friends about our holiday .
After six hours we had lunch on a fast food to France .
Next we visited a famous aquarium where I looked a lot of fish .
It was interesting !
On the evening we had dinner on a particular restaurant and my friends and I did many photo with a famous sight .
I was admiring the sea while my friends looked around the shop .
The days after we were in a parfurms and I bought a present for my mum .
My teacher wanted to our speak to French .
In the end my friends and I jumped into the sea .
It was crazy .
I will never forget this experience !
The cat LOZAH
At a nice day , my old brother surprise me .
He bought a cat .
It is a first time for me to play with a cat .
It is a nice experience .
I called it LOZAH because its color like an almond .
The almond is called in Arabic LOZ .
LOZAH is four months old .
It is female cat .
LOZAH plays with balls and ropes .
It likes my laptop and it play with the Cursor .
That is funny but makes me nervous .
The LOZA cat is Shirazi type .
It sleeps eighteen hours per a day .
The nice sleeping of it is when it watching anime .
It plays with children very well .
when the children went out it became sad .
I love its soft hair .
It runs behind the ants and flies .
It eats chicken , tuna , milk and cheese .
It hates the water .
When we need to punish it we spreed some drops of water at its face .
I hope it to be a good cat and a good experience for me .
Dear Bob ,
my firs job was baby sitter .
I have to look forward at two little boys : seven and nine years old .
I was seventeen years old , when I decided to accept this work .
The parents of these boys were friends of my parents .
I have been the baby sitter of these children for all that summer and I enjoyed so much with them .
They lived in a big house with a lovely swimming pool where we can swim and play .
At the end of the summer , I have kept on seeing these boys to help them during the school year .
This experience helped me a lot because I become much more responsible not only with these boys but also with my brothers and sister ( I had two brothers and one sister)and I have learned the meaning to work and receive money .
I did n't have problems because the children were quiet and respectful , and also because I known them since they were newborn .
I hope to have satisfied to all your questions .
Have a good work
cla '
I grew up in a parent family .
Sometimes I felt that I was alone and not loved .
However , we were lucky enough to have a great mother who tried all her best to keep my older brother , my older sister and I for completing our college studies .Of course my uncle , young brother of my mother gave a big hand to go through the hard , so that made us often help each other in my family when the member who was in hard .
Especially I was the youngest member in the family , made much more troubles when I was young .
I had truancy and did not pay attention to studies .
That really the biggest harm to a hard - working woman whom my mother tried all her best to feed me up and help me complete my studies .
All the members of my family never give me up , and I finished my college studies , too .I have a good job now .
I do really thank my mother and all the members for paying the patient and exertion to me .Now we have great relationship with each other and treasure the happiness we get not so easy .
So , are the members of my family my best friends?I'll answer you : there 's not much better answer than Yes !

More people are using it and it getting rush .
It creating lot of troubles by standing on the edge of the buses and metros .

Usually , I play football with my friends in stadium .

My favorite sport
There are so many sports in the world , like basketball , baseball , running , yoga , swimming , and so on .
Anyone has their favorite sports .
Someone likes go hiking , others likes dancing , still others like playing
volleyball .
And , either do I. I also like sports .
One of them which I like most is badminton .
Why my favorite sports is badminton ?
There are some reasons .
First of all , exercising can make you
become more healthy .
Second , playing badminton can active all body , like hands , arms , feet .
Third , when I
play it with someone , whatever just for fun or for the game , my body will feel so hot in thirty minutes .
Then , it can play indoor , also , it can play under the sun .
Finally , I am good at playing badminton .
Playing badminton can do lots of great things for you , expect good for health , it also can make a lot
of fun and play with family or friend happily .
If someone answer me what the best sport is , I will say :
Badminton is .
My favourite sport is badminton because I used to practise it when I was a child and I loved it .
It seems to me a complete sport because you can practise it in pairs or in an individual way .
To be good at badminton you need to prepare yourself in a physical way but also the psychological part is very important .
You have to be able to play for a long time , analyze your opponent 's mistakes to win and to have measure about your energy for no to be exhausted before the match is over .
For someone who is starting this sport I would give just one advise : enjoy .
Because if you are trying to win you will lose the most important thing , to discover how wonderful to play a sport could be .
now days young people are influence towards the western culture so , they are getting more fashionable.youngster are interested to wear different stylish and colored clothes.they are happy with wearing different color clothes.they did n't want to wear our cultural dress such as sari , dhoti , choli and many more.they only like to wear shirt , pant skirt , t shirt and many more.youngster are influence by watching different programmes on television .
Sport is important part of my life .
Two years ago when I was still in school .
Many classmates went to different sections of the sport .
But I could n't go with them at the time , I was sick a lot .
One day my friend invited me to karate .
He gave me 3 days to think about it .
I decided and went .
It was strange because I never went to the sports .
From the time I started going to karate .
After one month my instructor told me that I will go to the competition .
I was very worrying and nervous .
The day of the competition and I came with others to show how I 'd practiced .
Then instructor said my name and I went out on the Tatami.when I left I had a special feeling many people look and clapping .
It took 3 minutes I won with three accounts too .
I was very happy because it was my first competition .
After the end of the competition , we were all awarded medals and certificates .
Then as always sounded Kazakhstan hymn .
This time I felt like a Champion it was really especially feeling .
When I went to karate I 'm not even sick .
Sport has given me a boost of vitality , energy , optimism and strengthen the immune system .
My most exciting day was the June 8th 2014 , an international competition in Belgium .
The day before there were the qualifications , that I passed .
The day of the finals I was so nervous , but determined .
There were athletes who are European champions and I picked up all my courage and I did my exercises very well , except for a fall from the beam .
After the competition I was relaxed and happy , because I have done my job .
Eventually I placed 7th both beam and floor , and after we took the photos I go back to the changing room .
When I left , some girls were out of the dressing room with a sheet and a pen in the hands and they asked me an autograph .
I was really surprised and happy , I would never have thought !
The little girls thanked me , then I go to eat with my team and the day after we went back to Italy .
An easy recipe are cookies .
You need butter , flour , sugar , eggs , vanilla and chocolate .
Mix butter , eggs and vanilla .
The mixture must be smooth and compact . Pour the chocolate and cut the cookies with a round shape .
Baker them for 15 minutes

The world is changing around .
Technologies are moving on in high speed .
As the technologies world is moving fast and the auto mobile industry is also coming with new variant of cars & scooters in very economical way .
Buying cars and scooters are more convenient than the last decade .
In few decade people earnings and living style have also changed .
People now buying cars and scooters as per their convenience and pocket .
Earlier people used to buses , taxes , autos for reaching offices , schools , colleges , shopping etc .
Which was time consuming and obliviously cheaper way of commuting from one place to other .
Since today worlds is time saving world hence people do n't care about their pocket .
Using personal veihicles is more convenient to them than using public transport .
So the public transports importance is reducing every day .
If it so their will a time when single people will not interested for public transport .
This has tremendous impact on other aspect .
Fuel consumption has increased in few years .
Net of cars and bikes is reason for heavy traffic jam every side .
Ratio of road accidents has been increased in few decades .
People not even care about safety parameters while driving on road .
I must say that Public transport is life line in today worlds .
PUBLIC TRANSPORT
Public transport is a very useful resource , you can travel without polluting the atmosphere and it is very cheap .
But , why it will disappear ?
Nowadays , we usually travel very often to many different places , so for us is more comfortable our cars , but for the atmosphere and for our wallets , it is n't .
Using public transport we will avoid traffic and so many accidents , so why we do n't use it more ?
It will be a great advance for people and for the atmosphere , and as well for the countries because we will save a lot of money
I recommend you to use public transport .
I think that family 's members could n't be friends because the relation is very different .
There are many good reasons to say that .
Firstly , family is the base of the relationships .
Secondly , although the friendship and love are the most important feelings , the family structures the person and influences their behavior .
I feel my family in a different way from my friends .
Although I have a good relationship with my parents , I could n't think them like friends .
Some people think that this is possible but I disagree because it confuses roles in the family .
The parents have to give education to the children over obviously love
In conclusion I think that two relationship are different .
Perhaps I think that this statement is false because I think that statement should say that the the public transport is going to have in the future because travelling by car is not so much more convenient .
I think that travelling by car is good because you have your own sit and in the winter your car is hot and you also can listen to the radio .
In the public transport you do n't have your own sit so sometimes you travel standing which is not very comfortable and in winter you do n't have air conditioning so if it 's cold in the outside it 's cold inside the transport to , sometimes you have to travel with sick people that can transmit you the illness .
Otherwise the public transport do n't pollute but the car pollute so for us travelling by car is better than travellng by public transport but for the atmosphere is better travelling by public transport than travelling by car

Hello , my name is habiba jahid I am fifteen years old I live in Egypt .
I like English very much I like learning new languages and things .
I am not a native speaker of English but I wish that I will be one day .
what makes me like learning new languages is how it makes me communicate with others easily , I also like traveling so much as it makes me see new places and learn more about other countries around the world and their cultures and traditions however , I do n't travel outside my country because I am a student and I do n't have my own money which I can spend it on what I like .
my dreams when I grow up that I travel alot around the world , marry a romantic funny person , have a good life and be a good mother like my mother .
Years ago I was very worried how will happening in the future .
About the contamination , technology , obesity and other things around the world .
Nobody cared how we lived .
But , in this moment the people think different , is to start to help the world and
Contamination is big problem for us and the planet .
In the past the people bought thing , and they did n't care how is dangerous for the planet .
Now , the people is more conscious and they know how dangerous is for the planet .
Also , TV , radio , internet , big companies has adverisement for helping the planet .
Moreover , schools since kindergarten is educating for clean the planet , simply like separate the garbage .
Obesity and other thins about help , is a topic very important because the people is dying for this problem .
For example , the form to prepare the food , is gon na be dangerous because a lot food have artificial thing that is no good for us .
To turn to , alredy people cook the food in form organic o with products more naturally without chemical .
But this kind of food is expensive and the people can not buy .
Technology has good thing and bad things .
The technology is advancing very fast , in the best way this is good for us because we wiill do a lot of thing .
Maybe , in 2060 we will be able to go to the moon very easy , like go to Europe .
Also , the cars will fly , and maybe is better for the city .
In conclusion I think that we on track for the next years .
Compared with the past the people is more conscious and is worries for the world .
As a result for that we going to have a better life , more healty and clean for the next years .
I hope to continue in this way because is our future , is our life and we have to care it for have good and happy life in the next years .
No one can deny the importance of the public transport , but actually this importance is turn to private sector transport .
And this importance of private transport because private transportation provide a comfortable mean to move from one place to another , also it is help to keep a time and reduce costs which spending in public transportation .
firstly , that private transport provide a comfortable mean to travelling from one place to another without sharing stranger people a way and by using this kind of transport also comfortable in free with choosing time of a trip .
Secondly , it is a good way of travelling or moving from one place to another without wasting a time in waiting a specific time to move or even waste a time in waiting a public transportation to reach all point it should get it , but in the other side when you have your own transport or a private transport is get a right to choose time of trip or when you want to move or stay , and nowadays we can not waste our time in taking public transport .
finally , a public transport need more costs , because public transport ( such a buses , train ) fees every year is increasing , and this problem we do not face it by private transport ,

Now I will talk about the Daruma , a Japanese restaurant that was for me a very good experience .
First of all , the food was very delicious .
The Yakimeshi , the sushi and all the dished was like a taste of the real Japan .
Also you can see how they prepare your food in front of you .
The tables have a grill where the chef makes his magic .
All the place was surrounded by a nice and warm atmosphere .
That makes anybody feels a new level of pleasure , in the same process that everybody repeat everyday , eat .
It was a sunny day , a special day in my life.the day was 29 October in 2009,that day I had a university admission test at shajalaj university .
Before this day I was frustrated so it brings a happiness in my mind .
Very luckily , a beautiful girl sat on my bench .
With talking her for a few minutes , I become too happy .
In fact I fall in love with her at first sight .
So I was just thinking how to convince her .
there was no other option for me i just want her . during the exam time , i was thinking whole time how to communicate with her .
When the examination is over , again I started to talk with her , asking how was your exam .
She told me not good at all , but my was good and she also added that you may got the chance and finally I got it .
After three days later our result has been published and I got the chance but the girl did n't .
Then I become too much unhappy .
I expected if both of us get the chance then it will be very good .
But alas ! my dream did n't come true .
When I was returning from syleth I called the girl and talk to her and assure that I got chance in university but girl says that she knew it .

At present , many people think that English is the world language and it is absolutely an essential skill to communicate with other countries people .

Television is one of the most useful inventions of the modern world .
It is one such commodity which serves the dual purpose of both education and entertainment at one and the same time .
The tv shows broadcasted on television play a vital role in shaping the thoughts of the viewers .
I think , I can agree with the opinion , that shopping is not always enjoyable .
In my opinion it is dependent on that , what we buy and with who we go to the shopping .
To tell the true , shopping is so bored to men , particularly when they go to the store with women .
Shopping with women is nightmarish .
They always run in the shops and ca n't choose anything .
Then they are always crying and yelling like wild goats .
When I 'm listening this , I want to commit hara - kiri .
No future for public transport ?
why do use public transport some of us use it to save money for not buying gas or they ca n't buy a car or if they had problems in their cars or they do n't have the mood to drive .
Now a days with technology we have different ways to transport like hoverboards , skateboards and maybe it makes No future for public transport
Another point is we have our own cars and it 's more comfortable , I do n't have to wait in line to buy tickets .
I do n't have to be late for the delays , I can do anything in my own car I can put music I can drink , eat , speak or wherever .
I do n't have really an opinion I just do n't know.we will wait and find out .
Tell me your opinions about this subject in comments .
My Favourite Sport .
We are living in rush world .
All of us have to choose some activity .
In my opinion it 's have to be like brushing teeth .
We do it for hygiene !
My hygiene is running or more familiar word is Jogging .
Run Forest Run !
It is the most simple form of activity .
Jogging has existed since the beginning of the earth .
I can say that is the most natural move for human .
All that you need for become Runner its motivation and plan .
That what was happened with me personally .
Motivation for my been 15k run competition .
But I never before have work our Jogging .
So for finish competition with pleasure I needed work out plan witch is diary day by day about our jogging distance , time , mood during work out .
First of all it is absolutely minimum , you just need boots for run !
It is one main condition , rest of your dress are not important .
Shoes are for protect and prevent your health , you have got only one body look after them .
I enjoyed my favourite sport because I feel better after Jogging I think better and I meet lovely great people because of running .
My advice is : eat a lot of vegetables and fruit , drink plenty of water and run at least 3 times per week .
I will tell you a review of a thriller , the thriller is Hunger games it is about some capitals and people are choised and play on a game , you have to kill persons for they do n't kill you , is a movie that have suspense because you want to know ho survey , in the movie someone love someone and protect each others , is very cute but on the 3 movies they are bad moments with the family , capitals , Friends , etc .

I would like to explain about the my favourite sport cricket .
Cricket is a sport that have two teams of eleven playeres each ..
I like very much cricket because , it gives immense pleasure while playing the cricket .
We can enjoy cricket with our friends by playing cricket and we can also have fun , entertainment .
Playing the cricket will also gives physical exercise to our body.we can bowl , batt , field in the cricket which requires lot of physical activities .
Playing the cricket will gives relaxation and reduces stress .
I can give the advice to the people who are interested in the playing cricket they must know the all rules in the cricket before playing it .
My bedroom
My bedroom is n't very big and is untidy .
There are two desks with two computers , two chairs and two bookshelves with my brother 's school books and mine .
There are three bunk bed next to wardrobes .
There is a big window with curtains .
Finally , there are some posters and some shelf with my games .
My favourite sport is tennis .
This sport is an invidual sport , then you win alone and do n't win a team , but if you play tournaments in double the one who wins is the team .
This sport is very famous all over the world , but in Italy is n't very famous , becouse in Italy the soccer is more famous than the tennis .
But i know that a lot of joung people play tennis , i hope that the italian tennis player in a few years will be very famous all over the world , then you do n't wait you sign up in a tennis club and you will become a famous tennis player !
If you start playing tennis you go to a famous tennis club , or you choose the best tennis mister , who will introduce the tennis and you will the shots , including the forehand , the backhand , the smash and the service .
So you will become one of the most famous player all over the world and you will win a lot of tennis tournament , including the four slam : the Australian Open , the Us open , the Roland Garros and the Wimbledon .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
In 2 hours Mary 's plane was leaving and he had to go to the airport to stop her from going to Scotland .
He had to tell her she was in danger .
He went to the garage , and rode on his motorbike .
It was a cloudy , rainy day and there was a lot of traffic .
Though the road was wet and slippy , he rode his motorbike fast and skilfully , getting his way through the other cars and trucks .
My favourite sport is soccer . I like to play soccer because it 's a great sport .
It is great when you are in a cup and goes very far in the tournament .
It is also really fun to be with everyone who 's is whit in the team .
When you playing a cup you playing really much football and you are also very much with your friends .
When you go far in a cup you got to play a lot of games .
If you are going to begin playing football you need footballs shoes you also need protections for the legs .
If you starting this sport you need to think it 's funny to play it .
If you do n't think it is a funny sport you would not go it .
The best thing about football is that it 's a fun sport to play .
You should not play the sport just because you 're friends doing that , do it because you like to play .

Hi Alex I could n't wait until I see you
I really think taht we should go that new centre that you wrote about in your last email and do some of the activities .
I would prefer to do the sailing on the river , because as you know I never learn how to ride a bike .
But we could also try the climbing but it would be better if we could cimbing outside , in the countryside .
Perhaps on Saturday night we could watch a horror movie , as we both love , or comedy .
However if we not too tired at the time we could go out .
I will really like if my parents could take me to your house on Friday evening but I think that we have a party that night .
But I will try to convince they .
See you soon .
The future of public transport is one of the key issues large cities have to face .
Citizens want at the same time efficient and quick means of transportation , personalised solutions to meet their transportation needs , and the cheapest transportation cost .
Hi , Isabel .
How are you ? I hope you 're ok .
I have some to tell .
I have been living in New York city ! !
I used to live in Cancún but for my job I had changes mi city .
This place has some restaurants and sport bar 's when I can talk with latinos and I feel at home .
Emeil me soon and let me know how you are getting on next holidays .
See you soon . Kisses .
I think that public transport is much better for the enviromment than the private .
If the people travelled more often in public transport we would n't pollute so much .
I think that public transport is the future because many countries will have to allow the entrance in their towns to private cars for stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens .
So I do not agree with this afirmation , in mi opinion travelll by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than public transport .
After that kiss , Elizabeth was very surprised , but Jason was a little bit rigid .
Maybe he is sorry she thought , but why if she is perfect , she is everything that a man could want , so what happen .
-Are you ok ? - She says , a little bit afraid of his forthcoming word .
-Oh , amm- He gets a little bit of blush in his face- I … amm , I am sorry ! - He screams and his face gets totally red .
He seems different , she never imagined that Jason can be like that , she fantasy with someone , brave and strong , and she never foresees something like this , but she feel something for him , maybe she is in love with this guy .
-I'm sorry - he repeats again but more serious and with his normal face - Is cause , well is my first kiss ok ! , I can fight with Bloutums , Dragons , Two - Headed snake and everything that you can imagine .
But this thinks of l … lo … love , can put me very nervous- the blush comes again .
- jajaja- she smiles - it 's ok , do n't worry , it is my first kiss too , and I like it- she smiles again , but this time , the smile seems false .
Elizabeth apparent to be a very sweet girl , but Jason is not convince , because when he kiss her , he does n't feel nothing , he does n't feel that gravity disappear , and when his face turn red , he just put a face of horror and surprise , like if she was very sorry about kissing him .
Almost at the same time they kissed
-Hey , do n't run Snow
- But it 's very late Margarita , OMGG ( Oh my green god ) it is very late I 'm goanna die .
They stop in a dressmaker market .

Yes , the first one is the " Duque of Venomania " .

When they enter in the dressmaker market , Lucresia was n't there .
But there were a lot of beautiful dresses , in high - tech closets with lights .
-This dresses are made of textile fiber almost everything here is synthetic and portable for everyone - explain Snow .
- Wow , everything is beautiful , its make me feel like I am suspended in a dream of fairytale .
- Do you want to use one ?
-Yes but for what ?
-For the dance in the green palace .
- But are you sure
-Yes , just wait in a fraction of second you are ready .
My favourite sport is running .
I run everyday .
When I was running , I feel relax on it .
That is the reason why I love running so much .
Moreover , when I was running , I can through a lot of thing about myself or how to solve some of the problem from daily .
Therefor , running can let me feel happy .
In the past , cars are only affordable for the upper level while for the middle class and lower there are not many choice for them beside walk and public transportation .
Since technology and standard of living are improved , many people left the traditional habit in using public transportation and choosing car for several reasons .
The first one is to preserve time .
As we know public transportation has not a direct way to fulfill our all destinations then it force us to stop in many stations first , moreover we should take the other one to reach our destination so it is already obvious why using a car is better .
Secondly , public transportation usually very crowded and make us not feel safe since there is an opportunity for us to be theft .
Then by car we can enjoy the scenery , share laugh , change our destination by sudden and many more .
For these reasons , it can not be doubted if people think a car is more comfortable to be used rather than public transportation .
Since cars are affordable nowadays , a family can have more than one that make the number of car growing rapidly but they do not think further about the negative side effects that a car has .
Firstly , it leading us to global warming since the concentration of pollution are higher in many countries , moreover actually it is not only leading but also make global warming faster and also can threat our health .
Then roads are more crowded right now and there are so many traffics so people wasted longer time in the road , then it makes one of the positive points of using a car is gone and the importance of public transportation is needed .
While in the statement is written that public transportation will be left by many people , in my opinion is the opposite that public transportation is our future .
It can be proved by now that the willingness of people to use public transportation is higher , beside it is not as costly as using a car , the quality of public transportation are improved so citizen have no worry using it .
Would you like me to help you ?
There is n't any animal on the farm .
That is hardly surprising , it is close since 2005 .
You 'll have to take the cow by the horns and get some work done !
In the future , people will go out of the Earth .Because of the damage , people on the ground ca n't survive .
When they want to find foods , there will be nothing .
Even of the grass ca n't alive on earth .
Thought , but most people do not be the member of the team of alive .
Cause of lots of damage , but they did n't Take responsibility .
I wonder for sixteen years .
And I do n't know if they were change their mind in after the next fifty years .
Firstly , I agree about learning different concepts because you can analyse different opinions .
It 's not necessary to say the same words .
But you need , understand the main idea .
In other words , some professor when teaches different topics they explain the concepts and it 's difficult to learn .
Sometimes it 's so difficult say the same words for the students . I recommend read different ideas .
Anyway , if you read different books you can understand better .
In conclusion , it 's very important to learn the concept than saying something stupid ....
So , if you need techniques for learning you need to analyse and create your own words , this way you will never forget this definition .

Dear Carlos Sotelo ,
I am writing this letter because we need to improve the facilities in the gym .
In the gym they are many people .
The days that we have to do sports if the weather is good we do it outside but if the weather is bad we have to do in the gym .
That day we are many people and classes at the same time and sometimes we ca n't have the class comfortably .
Apart from this problem we have another problem that it is important too .
This problem is that some aparatus are brouken and the paint is bad .
For me the solutions to that 's problems are esey .
In the first problem you have to organis the time table in order to have 1 class in each time4 .
And the solution for the second problem is that you have to do maintenaits ouans a year .
I hope your positive awnser to me .
yours sincerely , Maximiliano Khachaturyan .

In the last year sales at Benton Electronics were in the first quarter of the year 500 and increased to 620 in the second quarter , in the third quarter sales maintained in 620 and in the last quarter of the year sales went down very quickly to 420 , as you can see sales were very unstables .
I just want to express about what I think painful , and I think coming back to your own home after many years of parting and seeing your closest person have departed is the most painful feelings ever .

My Life in University
The life in university have a lot of difficult and interesting things .
Of course , everything always have two - faced .
When I live in university , my life has become change a lot of .
Firstly , studying is very difficult because you have to accept new ways of studying- studying by myself .
In addition , my major is English so teachers will teach and explain by English , which I ca n't catch up on lessons well in the first time .
I was very inconfident about myself and i ca n't make friends well so I think that it 's too difficult to ask teachers or friends .
I always try to find out reasons which take a lot of time .
Moreover , I need to improve my skills such as reading , listening , writing , and speaking , they help me to catch up on my teacher ' s lesson .
Secondly , studying in university , I have to live far from house which make me be homesick , sad , and worried I have to live in dormitory with many strange friends , they 're very noisy and I have to share my room with my roommates .
It 's not convenient .
Everyday , I have to clean our room , wash clothes , I must take a lot of time to finish everything before I star learning .
The first time living here , i used to called my family and complained about here 's life .
However , life 's university have many conveniences .
Living alone , I have to manage money well .
Before I want to pay money for something , I always think carefully that I 'm really necessary or not .
Sometimes , I broke up nearly and I was really worried so I have to pay money suitably .
When I living alone , I have to save money because there are many situations which I have to slove without family , and you can become a good person with many good characters such as confident , independent , friendly .
Because my family always prepared everything for me when I lived with them so it 's very difficult to be independent .
But today , I have to do it , I have to solve my problem , manage money , wash clothes by myself .
In addition , I can be confident because teachers require everybody in class have to stand in front of class and speak English .
Living alone you have to make friends when you 're sad .
Studying new lessons from society .
Jogging the sport in the nature
My favourite sport is jogging .
During I go jogging I can think about all the daily thing in my life .
When I am in a bad mood I go jogging outside and hear how the birds singing .
For me jogging is very stressless .
At one day I go alone for me , so I can calm down or think through .
At an other day I go jogging with my best friend , so we talk a lot and have fun while we do sport .
Jogging is a sport you can start it every day .
You do n't need a lot of aquitment , so you do n't have to buy a lot .
I think for people who are fat , they can go jogging but a little bit slowler .
You have to notice that and go tomorrow jogging .
It is never too late to start .
Have fun !

We had taken lunch , so we started a little walk .
Then , we saw an eagle flying in the sky .
We had never seen such a beautiful eagle like that .
Charlie thought that if he was taller he might be able to take a picture .
Therefore , he climbed a tree .
Suddenly , when he was trying to focus the eagle with the camera , he fell down .
There are several reasons why there is no future for public transport .
One reason is that travelling by car is more comfortable .
If you share your own car with other people , you will save money .
Another reason is that you can hear the music that you like in your car .
For all these reasons , I think that travelling by car is better .

I and my family were backing for the holiday that we spending at the seaside .
We were going to gdańsk to seeing new statium that was built for UEFA European Championship .
We were saw the stadium , backed to car and wanted to drove to Bydgoszcz .
Bydgoszcz is my family city and destination of this journey .
Sadly our car was crushed ... in big and busy intersection !
This was n't some big , we still had four wheels and motor , but electronics in car stopped worked .
This was very scared !
We were n't have speedometer , blinkers and lights , it was very dangerous situation .
We were stopped on the side and looked for solution .
My father was rung for friends but unfortunately no one could help us .
We must took risk and went to nearest market .
In parking in front of this building very nice and crazy old man was helped us and charged acumulator in our car .
This was worked and we could backed to drove .
We were very scared because car could crushed again at any moment .
For this reason we were n't using a motorway .
Fortunetly we were backed to home healthy and happy but very very tired .
To pursue a career which is relevant to Mechanical field and expect myself to contribute my experiences and knowledge with enthusiasm and would love to take challenges and be yearning for the sense of accomplishment .
Shopping facilities in Moral de Calatrava .
This report shows the sorts of shop which are localizated in Moral de Calatrava .
1 . Shopping cheaply .
It is though that Chinnesse shops are the cheapest by far .
We are offered a lot of bargains in this kind of shop .
But maybe , the most important thing is the variety of products which can be found there : from cleaning products until a little furniture .
2 . Fashion in little towns .
Traditional clothes : that kind of clothes can be expensive but if you want to live like in the past , you can put on that and you will have really fun although that clothes went out of style a lot of years ago .
Something more fashionable : there are also a few clothes shop were you can find a lot of sorts of fashionable Italian and Spanish designes .
If you need something for a special event like a wedding , you can go to three shops which are specialited in that .
3 . Farmer markets .
Every Saturday morning , this village organizes a market where people can buy some natural vegetables or fruit which had been grown up by local farmers .
That is the reason why its price is so low .
Some pieces of advice :
-Even though you can find a lot of bargains , do n't spent too much if you do n't need it .
-Be careful .
If you look like a foreign people , local people can try to rip you off .
-If you buy some clothes , assure yourself that they fit you and you like them enough to conservate .
my town tries all the time to make our town more beautiful and comfortable by taking more care of the environment , they provide us by good buses which are friends to the environment and offer the tickets for this buses in a cheap price , they also trying to find the best way to make the rubbish more useful by the recycling , also the people tries all the time to find the best way for keep our village clean;they never throw the rubbish in the streets or the gardens , also they take care of the fuel in their cars to not to be bad for the environment , so , it 's our duty to take care of our village and the whole environment beside the government .
There are many accidentally problems encountered by international students studying in Australia .
It is believed that the most important one of the problem is culture barrier .
Because of different culture backgrounds , the talking style of internaional students who come from different countries are various .
Meanwhile , different countries have different rules .
For example , people always walk on the right of the road in China .However , Australian 's rule specify citizen drive on the left of the road .
Secondly , loneliness would be a big problem when a person who leave their own country getting away from family members and close friends .
Thirdly , students ca n't be accustomed to western eating habits like burgers , pizza and bread .According to the unfamiliar environment students may lack the sense of security .
There will evaluate viable solutions to the problem .
The most important way is that individuals should participate in student activities which held by the students from the same nationality so that they may not feel lonely .At the same time they can also actively communicate with local students to acquire more information about Australia culture in order to suit quickly .

A game of gentlemen is my favourite game , yes I mean Cricket .
In my country we follow cricket as a religion .
Cricket is played by 11 players , which includes a captain , a wicket keeper and rest batsman and bowler .
Player who can bat and bowl is called all - rounder .
This game is played in three format i.e. Test Cricket ( 5 day game ) , One day Cricket and Twenty - Twenty .
Test cricket is old format and I love this format as it really tests the players skills and only best player can get success in this format .
But as this takes 5 days many people do n't have time to watch this game and its loosing its popularity in young generation .
One day cricket is played often .
My favourite sport is football .I think , this game is the most enjoyable .
Its popularity spreads all over world too .
There are many reasons behind it to be popular .
Everyone is able to enjoy the excitement throughout of this game the session .
The people who eager to play football must follow some basic rules which are described below :
1.A football player should be punctual and hard - working .
2.He should be disciplined .
3.During his playing time , he sought to give his full concentration .

There is no doubt that the man 's lives are evolved .
All thanks to new creations technologies , the innovation in the field of medicines and the new scientific discoveres .
To my mind our lives has been improved in these years by smarphone , satnav , digital TV , Internet ..
Let 's suppose a teenager of twenty - first century during the Middle ages .. do n't get out alive without Wi - fii !
First of all in the next 50 years the people 's life do n't resamble at all this .
As far as I 'm concerned we would be submerged by too many tools which will replace manpower and craft , in addition the globalization will lose cultural traditions of each country .
On the one hand I 'm for development on the other hand I would that the innovations will not destroy the old .
Often the evolution is return of origins however I hope that the man in the next years will be to do n't forget the past .
Apart from that I imagine the world with everything automatic , planes that took me from New York to Dubai in three hours and robot instead of the weiters in a restaurant .
To conclude I ca n't think which wonderful thing the man will do in spite I hope make the word even better !

I can not agree with the statment of " no future for public transport " provided that the premise is " travelling by car is more convenient " .
First of all , the public transport is more rather convenient than irvate car .
The subway reaches most part of the London , and people can travel many places .
The accessibility is not just improving underground , but also on the ground and bridging .
Therefore , public transport will have a brilliant future .
The environment is becoming a more and more burning issue , especially from many years to nowadays .
That 's because pollution has now reached critical levels and that 's why we must take it under control and solve it .
We already know that a great part of the pollution comes from the exhaust fumes of the transports that invade cities worldwide .
However , we can already fight this - waiting the developing of advanced technology which can better exploit renewable , sustainable energy . - for example taking advantage of public transports .
The best idea is still , obviously , valorizing the use of bicycles .
Apart from that , even greater is the pollution of seas and rivers .
Polluting them is like endangering the life of the whole world .
This is caused by the waste of factories , but also by the damages that tankers do not only to the sea , but to the mainland too .
In addition , what about domestic wastes , which are our reality ? We should all learn to manage our wastes , because each of us , in our own small , is a great damage for the environment .
In conclusion , I think it is never too late for saving our wonderful world .
Why not do it now ?
Hello Joe
It 's good to hear from you !
Well , in my hometown there is about a little more than half a million people .
The nicest places to go are the malls , because of the very hot weather .
But if you leave the city about 30 km , there are a lot of rivers and waterfalls .
My best regards !

My favourite restaurant is situated in Modugno .
It 's placed in a quiet street , so the restaurant is often very relaxing , especially between 8 and 9 pm .
The furniture consists in a set of chairs , tables and some sofas , covered with red clothes .
The restaurant appears very elegant and traditional .
Usually , there is no music in the restaurant .
The owner prefers to leave on only the TV , but often the dining room is silent .
In this way , customers can have the chance to have a conversation , without being annoyed by television or music .
I find it appreciable : I really love to talk to the people I 'm eating with .
Despite this , the resaturant is decorated with a full set of musical instruments , hanged up to the walls .
I really like it , because I love music and I enjoy trying to guess which instrument I 'm looking to .
You can eat different types of pizza , starters and pasta there .
Everything is delicious and very tasting , especially pizzas : they dress them in many different ways : I try a different meal every time I go there .
At last , it is not expensive at all .
she finally felt that she is wanted that she could do anything she wants , and that no one is more clever than another , they 're all the same .
The thoughts which people put in her mind was absolutely wrong she ca n't deny that those thoughts affected her badly , reached her to the point that made her hate herself .
The words they said to her was a killing ones , they colored her life in black , till it 's the only time to prove to them that she can do anything , she 's good at everything like them all , that she just did n't want to do like them all as she just hated the way .
that 's it , not for being non clever .
being unsuccessful in studying is a horrible thing , it affects man badly .
That was me , I never liked studying , I never found myself in those subjects , but it was n't the big deal to me , I hated is being seen as unsuccessful or a loser , as I was n't that , I knew that I 'm clever enough to study all these subjects and do well in exams so I can get high marks but they 're all did n't get that , they judged me for my marks but marks do n't form brains or thoughts , marks is n't the only way that makes you great now and then in the future .
whatever , In high school the senior year here in our country identify your future ; the college you 'll spend your life studying in and working by its knowledge , so I get that i should do all my best this year so my future could be better . and it happened I showed them all that I can do whatever I want even if the things I was n't like as they see me , and that all my previous marks was n't my best . I got high score and entered The faculty of Engineering which was the top college .
People thoughts have the power to make you feel the best feeling ever and literally the opposite , just do n't think about anyone 's thoughts but you , as you have the control of your life not anyone else .
your thoughts are the only ones that will make the differences , so take care of them only and believe in yourself so you could reach the prestige you 're looking for .
Do n't give anyone the opportunity to make you give up and continue in the successful life , Fight .

Although I do n't have a teacher available there , the program helps a lot because the corrections appear at the same time you check it .
I intend to write every day for practice my writing .
I believe that it 's a good thing to share to everyone .
You should shout it from the rooftops !
In our earth , Hunderds of millions prople living in here .
Except us , There are also a large number of wildlife .
All of us need air\water and food .
Humans life also want house , And transport facilities .
A great number of bulidings stand in land ,
Even the please probably shold belong to animals .
We build road to us and make the life easy and better .
However , we forget the one importent thing , The earth is belong to all life .
Our flat and house make theaother animals lost they are home , and it is lead to environmental deteriation .
We take the thransport easy , hewever , we take away other animal 's life in careless .
THE PERSON I ADMIRE IS MY BROTHER , HE IS THE OLDER THAN MY BROTHERS , HE WAS BORN IN 1970 , MY PARENTS TELL ME " HE IS GOOD BOY " WHEN HE WAS A CHILDREN .
THE REASON WHY I ADMIRE HIM , BECAUSE HE WAS DETERMINED WHEN HE WON A SHULARSSHIP A STUDY MEDICINA IN RUSSIA , HE LIVED FOR 7 YEARS .

I 'm living in Taiwan , Taichung .
How is the area to take care of the environment ?
It build a lot of facilities for residents .
For example : Lots of Bicycles .
This provide people who want to go to a place that distance is not too long .
And it face another question : morality .
People probably destroy those bikes , and cause bikes become less and less .
But , fortunately , people living in this area all use these bikes carefully , so we do n't care so much that thing .
Second facility is public bus .
Large of bus all around the city .
When students finish their class , they take but to home .
Worker are off duty , taking bus to home , too .
And when the weekend is coming .
Family can take the bus to place to place , instead of driving .
It makes farther or mother more convenient !
Third , lots of green area .
Taichung have plenty of tree at the park .
So when children are playing around these tree , they can feel more healthy with pure air .
And that 's talk about the bigger area , Taiwan .
Taiwan has a complete traffic system .
Train , bus , Mass Rapid Transit , and air plant .
People living in Taiwan , no matter whether you are local people or not , you can use all of these facilities .
And lots of city government advocate protecting animals .
Good afternoon USA SUMMER CAMPS committee
I am Julia Timmerman from the Netherlands and I read your advertisement for working in summer camps in the USA .

It 's a quite strange sounds , because his father , grandfather , and greatgrandfather had been to travel time .
He could n't believe that .
But it 's so simple .
Go to a dark place , and then ckeuck the fist .
After the action , he can go to the time in the past .
After he knew the truth , he moves to London for his job .
He tried to go out with her .
So he used to his ability travel time for his family .

I am writing to tell you about the Spanish military academy .
This school located in Marin , where is in north Spain near Pontevedra .
The school is the Spanish institution in charge of training the Spanish navy officer class .
And it has been established in 1943.Moreover , there are not only the royal navy but also the royal marine crop .
Students have to study two parts which are engineering part and military part .
In engineering part , there are a lot of laboratories , which is help us to easy to understand about subject such as Physics , Chemistry or even Economics .
In military part , there are many obstacles and weapons for the marine corp .
And the are a lot of equipment for the navy cadets .
For example , the planetarium in a navigate room for learnt about the position of star , four small boats use for practiced the leadership and navigation in Pontevedra river , or even the simulation for maked the situations which are seldom happen .
To sum up , The Spanish military academy have a lot of equipment for teaching the future officers .
On the other hand , five years in school are not superficial because now there are not only the military subjects but also the engineering subjects .
But , I am really proud of my school .
There give me a lot of knowledge which I need to use in the future career .
A lot of people use public transport every day in this world , but some people prefer use your own car to go to the work , school , and whatever .
Some people have your own car , but prefer use public transport .
Today in the streets have a lot of cars , bus , motorcycle , other kind of transportation .
All the people should use your own car to go somewhere just when it 's necessary , because each car on the street is bad to our environment .
All the people should use public transport to reduce the number of the cars on the street

In my city there is an old town who was declared in 1986 World Beautiful City .
One of the most kown building is the Churruca Earl Palace , who has a medieval tower with the battlements ( the rest of the towers in the city does not have ir because the Muslims took them out ) .
As well is important because during de Civil War , the General Franco was living there for a week .
There is an office with so many things that he had there .
If you want you can visit it .
Nowadays the Palace has a very good restaurant with a comfortable patio where you can taste the most exclusive products from Extremadura .
The present chapter aims to introduce audiovisual translation ( AVT ) - one of the most popular type of translation nowadays .
Audiovisual translation brings a lot of dilemmas and constraints with which translators must agonise .
But it exists a variety of techniques which helps to tackle with this kind of problems .
So , I will elaborate on this subject .
The chapter will also cover the definition of the notion of pun a stylistic figure and how puns transfer from one language into another .
In extension of this , I will evaluate whether the effect of the pun in the original version is maintained in the dubbing version .
I live in Serdobsk .
The people in my town take care of the environment .
The garbage cans are about each home .
Garbage truck pick up them twice on the week .
There are many a small garbage cans about cafe , stores , and other public place .
Every morning special track to clean the roads and walk way .
The advance of technology in the last years has been awesome .
The first computers was created in 1946 for John W. Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert in the United States .
In 1960 , computers were very basic .
They were bigger and heavier than today and they were very expensive .
Its keyboard had a lot of buttons and its screen did n't have any colours .
Computers did n't have any programmes and resulted limited , boring and tedious .
In the present , computers are multifuncional .
For example , they have Internet access .
WiFi , port USB , among other things .
These computers are very popular .
They are faster and smaller than before and you need a mouse to use it .
Its screen has colours and HD

In my opinion , the public transport has future because this is cheaper than other transport , also its pollution is lower .
The car is a transport more comfortable than the public transport but is not sustainable , its cost is higuer and if all people move by car , The cities will be very pollutes .
Also , in the big cities , the public transport is more punctual than the car because this transport usually has its own lane , while if you use the car , you takes more because there are a lot traffic in your lane .
Other transport that can be very used in the future is the bike , this transport is cheap and ecological , also , more and more the cities are building a lot bike lane so is a good alternative .
For travelling other cities or town , in my opinion , the car will remain the transport most used , although the new transports could change this situation .
For the finish , I think that the transport most use in the cities in the future will be the bus , metro and bike and for travelling enter cities the car will remain the most used .
Dear James !
Thank you for inviting me there !
It was really enjoyable and funny .
I was especially delighted with national music and Latin American dances .
I would like to invite you to the celebration of my birthday in two weeks .
Bye !
Your dear , Vitaly
There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
Now a day , more and more people have their own car .
When they go out for work or other purposes , they choose to drive by themselves .
People do n't need to wait for public transport if they were driving their own cars .
It is not only convenient but also time saving .
With these benefits , it seems that there will be less and less people willing to take the public transport .

My favourite sport is football .
I play this sport since I was child , and today I still love it .
The dream of every person that play this sport , as well as a hobby , is to make it a profession , but very few people did it .
Nowadays I play football twice a week , Monday and Friday , because for me it is remained one hobby .
I like to play football cause for me , as well as one hobby , is one way to stand out of the world , of the problem that every day I have to face , and at the end it makes me calm and happy .
I recommend this sport to all people , because it could be , as me , one moment to distract from the world , one moment to spend without thinking about tmorrow .
The football could be one way to meet your friends , and to spend time with them .
Trust me , I 'll be right .
My undergraduate studies in Pharmacy at the University of Asia Pacific gave me a solid background in health care sector and chemistry , as well as strong theoretical framework , while allowing me to explore my personal interests in pharmaceutical technology .
This undergraduate work along with the diversified professional experience helped shape the specific research interests that now drive me to pursue graduate work in the field of Industrial pharmacy and gave me the opportunity to learn and work with the new medicines and delivery ensuring their safety and quality academic and research opportunities for my interest in pharmaceutics as a scientific career .

I Live in Egypt .
It has a lot of historical places .
The most historical place is the Pyramids , they were built since more than 7000 years ago .
If any tourist decide to visit the Pyramids , he / she shall enjoy riding Camel , horses or buggy .
Also having some pictures will be a great idea .
The pyramids are famous because of the way they are built , it was a great job by the Egyptians .
Many people think that for badly behaviour of young people are responsible their parents and they should be punished for that .
I agree with that only in part , because in my opinion there are some more reasons .
First of all , when children are small , they are polite and always listen parents , for example they are doing homework , going to sleep in regular hours and back home after school .
This is a time , when parents could create behaviour of their children , because when they grow up , they are beginning rebel and do things which are good in their opinion .
Secondly , for behaviour of older children like teenagers have an impact other factors , it are not only their parents but other people , whose surrond them .
It is a time when children must choose , which people are good or bad , which way they will go to difficult situation for example they will be drink alcohol or they will have fun without any suplements .
When they choose bad , they could began stopped do things which were important for them in previous period in their life .
In summary , I would like to point out that the most impact for young people have their own , because life is a time when people only choosing .
Parents are very important , because they can suggest some solutions , but final decision must undertake their children .

This week was a little bit difficult because it was the beginning of classes , I got up early to be on time for my classes and to start with all the enthusiasm in the new semester .
The next day , on Tuesday was hard for me to get up , but the simple fact of seeing my classmates it was so much easier .
I arrived at the school with all the energy , and I decided that this semester will be better than the other .
Thus the classes have just begun with new teachers and others who have already taught me .
What heavy was that teachers have already given us all homework for the week .
Later , I went to my house with my mom and I helped her make the meal and did the clean up .
After that , I did my homework because I had a lot of and it was pretty hard .
So every day I kept awake .
My dad told me do your best and if this semester going well for me , my dad will give me a tablet because I really need it .
So this is my week .
However on Saturday I went to English classes in the evenings .
Later , my parents , my brother and I went to turn around to relax us from all the stress of the week .
Finally , on Sunday I rested at home with family .
Every second , every day , every week , every year , the life goes on and the human discovers a new thing .
The scientists try to make people 's life easier but that 's harmful for people 's health because that make people do n't move and more fat .
In future , The cars will fly and be faster .
we wo n't use oil as a fuel .
we will find a new resources for energy which will be clean and cheap .
The renewable and new energy is clean and so cheap , we can use the sun rays to generate electricity for houses and cars .
The computers will write what you think in , the mobiles will be smaller and less weight .
The tourists will travel to another plants , The people will live at moon and under seas or oceans .
Working as an ITC si very exciting because you need to program all , is like a challlenge , although you can do varied things . You can be in duty in your house and deal with your boss in the cellphone so do n't be alarmed if your son 's bother you .
Is a little streesfull when you have a lot of work .I hope when I have me job be in charge of security IT department .
It 's a very worthwhile job .
I agree with that opinion because I do n't like shopping at all .
I think it 's very silly when you go to the store and you have no money .
But you want to see all goods and maybe buy one of product .
It looks very stupid .
But if you have much money you can go and by something from the fact that you really need .
Everyone has an opinion on this statement .
There is no accounting for tastes and I can not answer for everyone .
i do n't know my name .i do n't know my age all i know about that i want to be a great woman , i want the world to hear my voice , to prove that i can do it i can do any thing i am not weak i have woman power

Once upon a time , a young boy called Michael , was walking opposite of a beautiful lake .
When , he saw into the water , he found a little ill frog .
After that , Michael decided to bring it up because the frog was very ill .
The frog got well while I was at home for two months .
However , Michael discovered that it was a bad wizard .
The wizard attacked him and he went away from home .
Michael closed the door and kew at that moment he had made a mistake because he lost his house .
It was a sunny and hot day , Peter decided to go to the waterfront promenade and have a walk .
He was feeling so free because of the fresh air .
Suddenly , he heard a high - pitched scream .
Then he saw a woman started to jump over the enclosure !
Peter thought that he must do something quickly to avoid her from committing suicide .
He shouted out loud for help but no one was around him .
So he contacted the police for help immediately .
In a flash of an eye , the police came .
At last , the life of the woman was saved by the police and the police thanked Peter for confirming them .
The one I most admire is called Ronaldinho , a football player that in my opinion is the best of all time .
He won only one gold ball , but he should have won more than that .
He mostly played with number 10 even thouhg he also played with numbers 80 , 45 .
He was born in Porto Alegre , in 1980 , and played in several teams like Barcelona or AC Milan .
The skills he make are wonderful , he know everything about football , his passes were fantastic , he passed the ball even with the back !
Even though most of people think that Messi or Ronaldo Nazario are even better than him , other people think same as me .
There are 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms .
The kitchen looks like small and simple .
The living room shares area with dining room .
We have a small garden .
My mom likes growing plants such as vegetables .
it all started when I found a book on the bus .
This book made me interesting and I begging reading more and more while I read the more I love it this time everything did not matter to me I want to finish the book as soon as possible I do not know the end but I want the end of the book was amazing but the same time I do not finish the book because the mystery to open up finished in .
In the end a lady interrupted me and I was angry about the situation .
that was the reason I do not finish the book
Nowadays our world is fighting everyday against diferrent problems , one day there is the problem of violence , one day the atmosphere conditions or many others .
Today we can try to imagine how our lives can change in the next 50 years , if it will be better or worse .
In my opinion everyone 's life will have a great improvement , from the economic point of view but also from the social and cultural one .
It is known that in the future will come the day in which any kind of unrenewable resource will finish .
But I imagine that in the next years we can begin to spread the use of alternative resources , as the eletricity given by the light of the sun rays .
Or in addition , we can use the energy given by the environment , as the wind or the inorgainc rest .
Maybe there will be also great new discoveries from the medicine that will make disappear any kind of diseases .
To sum up , I think that we have to expect a great future in which men will regain possession of his whole capability and thanks to it he will change everyone 's lives in best .

I 'm interested in sport;football .
Because it 's the most common sport all over the world as well as I 'm good at football , so I play football with my friends every weekend always play on Tuesday evening .
Also , it 's good for fit and health .
I 'd like giving you some advice about how to start playing sport .
I think it 's good idea if you buy some kits for football and training with your friend before match at home or playground for two or three days .
Next , you can play with anyone on confident and control match .
moreover , sometimes why do n't you run in the morning ?
In my opinion , it 's useful to play football .
THANKS
I understand what you mean because cars are so convenient as you said .
You can go anywhere , anytime you want .
You do n't need to care about time tables .
Also , during your journey , you might be able to stay night in your own car .
But nowadays , cars are one of the reasons to cause the earth warming and air pollution .
Car companies try to spread electric cars but it seemed to take a long time .
And some people have already switched to use public transport like trains or buses .
Moreover , it 's still popular to travel long journey with trains or ships because the scenery you can see from them are totally different from the one from cars .
According to these reasons , I do n't think there is no future for public transport .
" Annabelle " is a horror movie which i am going to watch this Saturday .
I am wondering if i will be scared after the movie .
The movie is about a doll called Annabelle which was closed in a museum from Conecticut where she is visited by a preist who blesses her twice a month .
John From finds the perfect gift for his pregnant wife : a beautifull colection doll dressed in a wedding dress .
Unfortunatelly , in a horribble night the couple"s house was invided by a satanist group who attack them and leave just blood behind them .
The satanists invoced an eavel entity that is capabale of the worst things ... Annabelle .
After Mia gives birth to her doughter Lilly , Annabelel wants to kill her .
Even the preist doesn 's know how to help the unhappy familly .
Everyone is terryfied and find out that a demon is attached by the doll .
Idon't know the end of the story but i don;t think that is a happy one ...
The aim of this report is to highlight how the citizens care of the environment , in order to give suggestions to keep this area clean .
In the matter of that , information concerning what people do , or could do , are going to be shown .
Few people who live in the suburban areas have the following routine :
1 Check if your dog or anyone else 's pet damages streets or gardens .
2 Divide wet rubbish from the products which can not be recycled .
3 Denounce those who leaves rubbish in the wrong spaces .
Disadvantages :
If the majority of citizens , including the ones who live in the city centre , had followed these ideas , this city would have been surely cleaner .
Unfortunately , deeper problems are linked to the difficulty that all the inhabitants respect those principles .
Some thought that volunteers should involve careless people in many project to keep their city attractive and marvelous .
It is proven that to be a part of a project always make people feel useful .
I would , therefore , recommend this idea .
Nowadays we can see that each time more public transport need to improve the quality of your services , the people daily need this kind of transport go to work , go to school and in general depend so much of the public transport .
The government can to improve the public transport making a great investmenting like changing the old vehicles for new and increase the number the bus , trains and build more bus station and trains station this kind the action will help a lot the quality of the public transport for population and will become the life of the people more easy .
Today many people prefer to travel by car than public transport because of the bad quality services , the bus , the trains are full and many times are until dirty and late .
However if this situation not change and if our government not take providence about this important subject will be the end of the transport public and will more convenient to use car .
I am writing this letter because we have to improve the gym of the school .
The gym has many problems that we are gouing to explain :
the first problem is that we do n't have enough aparatous for all of the students
the second problem is about that same aparatous are not working well because the school did n't the manteinace long time ago
For the first problem in my opinion , the school have to buy some others aparatus because there are not enough for all of the students
For the second problem the solution for me is to hire someone to do the maintenance and say to all of the students to take care of the machines of the school
I hope my proposal wiil be useful for you
I look forward to hearing from you soon

I work as freelancer journalist , prepare reports dealing with a whole situation in the city of Jerusalem , and publish my reports in many of the websites .
I am also committed to preparing monthly reports for newspaper supplement " The Voice of Women " which issued by the WATC " Women 's Affairs Technical Committee , and I have the cooperation with the Environment and Development the magazine which issued by Center for development work " Maan " , annd other web sites and news and media organizations .
the world is sadly lacking in an environmental mind in consequence , it caused the global warning which been the most important global problem it does n't mind to more than three quarters of the world population .
Currently we have got more than six different types of banks in our streets but as far as I know it is not sufficient to meet the needs of the environment because nowadays we do produce a lot of different materials , all of them overproduced and we do only learn this education in our home in our childhood , accordingly I am one of the few worried teenagers in the world about it so I really do help the environments as far as I can .
Frist of all at home we recycle plastics , glasses , papers and cartons , oils , clothes , batteries , organics in an especial composting bank where we avoid burning or burying in excess those scraps with other materials and finally all the other things are sends to an especial tip where we avoid to drop it anywhere . then when I have time and I see a senior citizen in the street introducing their scraps bag in an wrong bank I explain them who they have to recycle and who important it is for our environment carefully recycle it
A couple of years ago , I hardly could see any bins in supermarkets and houses .
Nowadays , I see everywhere bins and even a small kid of 3 years being teached to put unwanted materials in the bin .
It is truly an amazing experience and how much progress my small village has had done in 2 years of time .
Even though , there are not provided separate bins for different categories of dirt .
So , We can easily see people throwing everything in the same bin .
In spite of throwing dirt in a bin we also making some harm to environment unknowingly .
As there are different kinds of materials , dirt . some are renewable and some are not .
In my opinion , in the next 50 years , humanity will increase and there wo n't be resources enough for everybody .
There will be on another planets , for example the moon , many citadels inside an enormous domes .
Then , I suppose that in every country will be used much more renewable energies instead nuclear energies for reassure a secure future for the next generations , and maybe everybody will use electric car for decrease the atmospheric pollution .
The people 's live will change even by policy and the economy .
I hope that in the future there will not be any war by the economic crisis .
I think that public transport has a future , indeed travel in car is much more comfortable , because you do n't have to walk to take a bus or the underground .
But there 's a thing , no one have enough money to buy a car or maybe two ; that 's why there 's a lot of people who prefer the public transport .
Perhaps in a future public transport it can be more comfortable for the rest of the people who does n't have a car .
I think that there is n't for public transport because nowadays the people usually use your private car .
This is some adventeges such us it is more comfortable and fast .
when you travel by bus you must have a timetable and it is less comfortable than travelling by car .
However when you go by car you can take your car whenever you want .
Sometimes private transports is cheaper if you go is other people .
for example when you go by car you can go with other people so you pay less money for gasoil .
On the other hand , private transport are damaging for planet because we must take care of the planet . we can help to prevent the contamination of the enviroment , if we take travel public transport which do n't pollute .
At the moment , there are more one car to person , it is a problem for me because people do n't take cure envarioment .
they prefer to be comfortable .
in conclusion using public transport produce less damage to the environment and most people prefer .
I want to describe a famous actor from my country , he is Sergey Bezrukov .
He participates in many interesting movies and operas .

I think he deserved to be famous , because he is a very talented person .
Now he has opened his owned company .
I am plannning to visit his company .

Life is unpredictable and unforseen .
The immense possibilities of life give us opportunity to explore life but some times it lead to threat and dangers to our life .
We surely pray for the best life of our dear and near ones .
But insurance is also necessity and invetable for peace of mind .It gives us surety to live life securely .
It just not only to save our life but also secure assets like houses cars etc .
The insurance for non accidental death is known as general insurance and for life is known as life insurance .
But we still sold it not bought it .
Number of countries give attention and provide secure life to their citizens .but our country still under insurance .
Government should play key role by providing trustworthy organization surveyors loss assessors etc .
To aware people by run awareness campaign .
To provide insurance at nominal prices.and claim polocies should be easy .Give surety so that people can accept and trust the insurance companies .
Fdi can play important role in it .
It give competition to national companies .By virtue of which they work properly mannerly and give better option to policy holders.people can always buy nominal premium we should aware them about the types of insurance as well as benefits of the insurancce .

Second , soccer is very interesting game because when I play soccer I feel very happy .
Moreover , soccer help human body to be very healthy because when someone play soccer his organisms become strong .

I would like to say for anyone wants playing soccer to be very careful when he plays it because it may cause a lot of injures , but in the same time it is very nice game .
Hello John !
I read your e - mail , so let 's talk about books ! I usually read a book on my free time , because I prefer story than short articles .
Recently I read four great books about Shoah , they were very interesting , my favourite was : " The Book Thief",I read it for school , but I have already saw the film of this book .
It 's a very mooving book , but it is n't difficult , I think that 's for teenagers , but is also good for adults .
I love the thing , that in this book , there are a lot of German words , so I also could improve my German ( I go to the languages high school ) .
And what about your book ?
What are you reading ?
I hope you 'll answer me soon .
Bye Serena
Last Friday I 've visited Balla without any planning .
I usually wake up at 10 am at that day my father called me at 8:00 am and asked me to go Balla with them .
He usually avoids me in this kind situation .
Nowadays he treats me as botheration .
That is why I was very surprised .
The reason he told me to go Balla is Noman will feel alone there as Badhon and her mother is not going .
I was in a bit hesitation latter decide to go .
Actually I do n't have enough courage to say no to my father .
I got ready very quickly so I did n't do my morning exercises .
We have been told earlier that Abul kaka has got a very nice PAJERO Jeep from office nonetheless the performance of the vehicle was awful that day .
It shut down at the road for several times while we were on the way .
So I was feeling very anxious that if the car fail in Aricha highway .
Because I was so sure Abul kaka and Noman will prefer Aricha highway rather than the Singair road .
I do n't feel comfortable in hi - ways for many reasons .
Those are the most risky roads of the country . if there is an alternate way I always use that .
That 's why when I go to village I like to use the Singair Road than DHAKA - ARICHA highway .
My father also uses this road .
When I was a youngster , my father and I rode motorcycle to visit our place using this road .
As I was a kid I fall asleep sometimes .
May be for that I have a high regard for the road .
noman engaged the front seat .
Though he was unwilling to sit there as because abul kaka or my father should be seated there .
But they insist him .
So we four were occupying the back seat uncomfortably .
When the car stopped to take oil at a service station near Gilando , my father asked me to go the very back benches of the jeep .
I thought I should n't come as because those benches were disgraceful for me .
I feel like I 'm depriving by my family .
If I were in a better position it could not happen to me .
Peoples humiliate me in many ways because I do nothing for earnings .
I found it very painful when my parents do it to me .
I keep my brain cool and try to overcome the situation by thinking one day I will prove myself . I know who I am and what I 'm doing .
My thoughts are unquestionably better than others .
Hence I 'm waiting for good time .
We reached our home at 1:00 pm as well as planned to back Dhaka at 4:00 pm .
It gives the impression that only going and coming in a big car is the main purpose of the tour .
That was ridiculous .
That the I spent most of my time with Noman with his over talking habit .
My usual stance with this kind of person is to listen .
We visited nagar chak with much anticipation .
In this season I kike to see the sun shine .
The crystal clear and mild sun is very favorite of mine .
While I was listening noman I was discerning that I should question more .
When he talks he has done many mistakes because of his over talking habit .
at 4:00 pm we set for Dhaka was an early move because of faulty car .
I fall asleep as soon as we crossed jhitka bazar in addition when I wake up we had crossed Tora bridge .
We stopped our car to a road side tea stall to take tea .
Than we set for Dhaka .
We talked about a lot of things .
When we talked to our seniors I think I should control myself though they talked unreal things .
They prefer industrialization over nature .
At the same time they also keep saying that nature was more green and vigorous in our time .
A never ending argument took places and thus we reached Dhaka .
Travelling or moving from place to another by car is much more convenient for a man than public transport .
By car you can go whenever you want on time with no need to wait for hours at the stations for bus or subway .
It is faster and cleaner and much more comfortable .
For example , if you are in a hurry and want to catch the place you are heading to , you can drive as fast as possible .
You can have some other choices that you can stop to buy something : water , juice or snack if you get hungry your way or thirsty .
You even can take a rest for awhile pleasingly to sleep or to have a nap .
You would n't suffer anymore from the trouble or annoying stuff on bus most of the time like : no room for you to sit , bad smell people can make , or get bothering or bushing .
It 's convenient already .
But , on the other hand , because of recently traffic has been terrifically unbearable ; cars are so many ; very noisy , unclear air produced has become the public transport better to save earth .
In all over the world people always need advices to keep looking after their environments .First , the municipal should do workshops in schools and universities providing students by tips that should help us to make our environment clean .Second , they should make awareness campaigns about environment ; for example , telling people to put their rubbish in waste papre basket which helping workers to recycling it easily .Finally , to stay healthy we need a healthy environment .
I used to find a kung - fu sensei to teach me .
But at the region where I live I had not found .
Sundly , started krav maga class in a gym close to my house .
I did not think two times .
I went there and sang .
I discovered a new world .
It is a good self defence ... it is object , simple and fast .
Krav maga teaches how to control ourselves in hard situations .
Sometimes we are with people that we love .
When someone wants to hurt our relatives or friends , we must do something .
There are a lot of bad people in the street .
If it was not true , the life would be so better .
The most exciting day of my life was when I and my sister discovered that we would spend one week on a cruise with our friends ! that was a very beautiful Holiday !
We spent a lot of time together every day ; we visited some fantastic cities in Greece like Santorini , Athens and many others .
In Italy we also visited Bari and Venice too .
Every day we spent time on the beach and across the sea .
Every evening we went to the restaurant on the cruise .
Meals were very good and also in the morning I ate English breakfast or eggs and bread because I wanted to change my routine while I was on the cruise .
I think it 's the most exciting holiday I 've ever spent and my favourite too .
I and my classmates with our teachers and other classes went to the cinema to see the film " Fantastic Boccaccio " .
It was an interesting experience to go to the cinema to my class and see in a film what I have studied during the Italian lesson and understand better the stories of Boccaccio , one of the most important Italian writer .
Seeing the film we have had the possibility to watch the characteristics of the main characters of Boccaccio and the different places where the stories took place .
In my opinion the film was made in a very good way : the registers of the film ( they are two ) tell us five novels with only one main protagonist : the love in every situation .
The registers of the film said that they want to create a film without time , and they were able to create this .
The scenes of film , the costumes and the music are very beautiful and I suggest this film to all of my friends .
According to the past century , we have seen lots of change in the world .
It 's obvious that nowadays is really different from 50 years ago , so we can predict that the people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
When it comes to change , we can think of what way of our lives is still inconvenient that it can probably change .
Most of the labours will probably have been represented by machinery , the people who is lack of academic might be very hard to get a job , the knowledge might be demand if the people live in the future .
There are some issues that make worried , the environment is getting worse , we have to come up with the methods to solve this and save our Earth .
The relationship among the countries is also significant , as we can see discord is among the countries , hoping that it will not draw the war .
television entertains as well as it will educate the people .
These days are educating themselves by watching the television .
Televison not only provide entertainment it will give lots of information about the happenings around the globe .
Channels like national geographic and animal planet will tell us the animal behaviour and the origination of species .
Few programmes some intellectual programs will increase the creativity of the people
When Michael wake up that morning he feels , a strange smell in the air , he do not know what is the origin of that strange smell but , in his noose , he receive a kind of sign something bad happened .
Very quickly he went of and try to put of his head of that sensation , but ... the smell , the feelings , the sign ... but " what ?
what is that ? " he thing .
He star watch the kids there running , playing , laughing a lot , the same couple of yesterday talking about love , the sadness in the city .
With a great effort sate down on the grass , he feels tired , and has a little sensation of pain in his boson , site there with many sounds on air , he star recall ... his face is changing is dark , he has now a clear image of all , when opened the door of the house his girlfriend is there dying on the floor , Michael remember all , the fight , the lays , the screams , the knife ... the blood ; but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
The diabetes is the increasing of the glucosa in the blood , The have two types , first the Diabetes Type 1 that is predent in childrens , pacient needs insuline every day , also this diabetes is caused by the destruction of the insuline realized by the person 's immuny siste .
The Diabetes Type 2 is present in adults people , the insuline is generated but this not work in the body , so the amounts glucose is storage in the body .
This diabetes is caused by the bad alimentation of the people or because the people have a bad life .
So it is necessary to eat vegetabl and fruist and also to do ejercises .
My view is that public transport is good because it has prevent pollution which is good for the public .
May people can think travelling by car is more comfortable for them .
However , they must understand travelling by car is not any kind of exercise .
if planned to travel by public transport people will walk to bus station and get down from the bus and walk for necessary thing .
So my opinion is good for both parties

Hi readers of international sports monthly magazine .
I wrote to sponsorize my favourite sport , the most beautiful sport in the World ,
basketball .
basketball is a complete sport , aerobic and anaerobic .
it 's a team sport , the team it 's made of 5 people and you need a ball and a hoop .
I enjoy this sport because I love team sports and games with a ball .
Some people say that basket it 's only for tall guys
but it is n't true , in the A league in Italy we have different players not very tall
like 1 meter and 60 , so if you love this game you can play it no matter what
find only a ball and a hoop and play it .
If you want to start this sport , find a friend that can teach you the basic movements and how to pass and shot
than the practice makes the rest .
if you train and you have willpower nothing can stop you .
Nowadays basketball is spreading around the World .
I hope that the amount of players will increase and increase every day more .
so let 's play basketball .
Ryan Gordon loves all sports but he works hard at school too .
At the moment he is doing three A levels at camden college .
He is going to go to university next year .
At the weekend he usually plays football or basketball and this year he is learning how to roch climb .
He goes twice a week to the local climbing center .
School is finishing in two weeks and next summer he wants climbing in Scotland .
I have the best friend when I was a student at high school .
We studied hard together to prepare the university exam , shared about our problems and almost things has relatived with us .
It 's great time for me .
He made me happy and safe .
He seemed as my boyfriend .
The first year of the university , I showed my love to him .
Unfortunately , he refused me .
I had an affair love .
Day by day , I tried to forget my love in his quiet .
I did n't call , send message and met him .
Although I did well for a long time , one day , he contacted again with me , so I did n't ignore him .
He said that he wanted to be the best friend as before .
But no , what I can do it ? I still love him , even my love become bigger .
What I should do ?
Should I show my love again ?
Last week from September 11 to September 21 , we had a minivaction .
From September 11 to September 14 , I did nothing besides watching TV , taking care of my little sister Ellie and chat with my friends .
On the rest of the boring week , I solved a 1000 pieces puzzles .
On Sunday , my family and I went to Causeway Amador then to Albrook Mall .
After the examns finished , I went home and had nothing to do , so I thought that I needed to watch my dramas because it was a week I haven't watch them due to the exam week .
So after watching all my dramas , I had nothing to do .
From September 12 to September 14 , I was too lazy because I was tired of the exam so I was all day laying on the sofa doing nothing apart of watching the TV and chat with my friends .
Besides I needed to take care of my little sister Ellie , who is very cute and funny and right now she is always trying to get up and stand and walk .
On the rest of the boring week , I was watching TV and suddenly my cousin found some pieces of the puzzle inside the cabinet , so I decided to solve my Paris puzzles with my sister , which was less than a half solved for about one year but it had too much color in the sky so I did n't finished then a year ago .
We began to solve it again and took us the whole week to finish it .
While solving the puzzle , I decided to count how much pieces was left , after counting them I realized that five pieces were missing .
I was too angre because I was finishing the puzzles and five pieces were missing so I began to search the whole house for the five pieces but did n't find it .
On Saturday , I finished my puzzle but with five pieces missing but I was happy too .
I finished it .
On Sunday , my father planned to take my whole family to Causeway Amador .
Also my uncle , aunt , grandfather and cousins went with us .
After arriving to the Causeway , my brother and my cousins went to drive bicycle for one hour .
I was hoping that my father can teach me to drive the car but was not possibly because we went to Albrook Mall to eat and my father did n't want to return to Causeway Amador to teach me drive .
Mini vacation can be fun but sometimes boring because you haven't planned anything for the vacation .
The best thing I did was to solve my beautiful Paris puzzles and went to Amador with my family and have a good time with them .
Mini vacation are a break for us to have a fun and good moment with our adorable and lovely family and friends .
when I was child , I wore usually blue , grey and red colours .
My bedroom is blue and orange , the colours of my toys when I was child are different .
I chose always my clothes because only me know my favourite clothes and when I was child my toys .
Now I wear different colours for example black , blue , grey and other .
Maybe they will change
Pompei - the destroyed city
I 'm sure you 'll agree Pompei is the most important archeological site in the world .
It was destroyed by a vulcanic eruption in 75 BC .
Vesuvium - this is the vulcano 's name ! - covered it with a lot of cinder so that walls , houses , food , clothes , corps of citizens has been preserved as well they were .
You can walk through the same streets and enter in the same shops the romans entered some centuries ago !
It is n't incredible ?
Besides is possible to book special tours in which there are guides dressed like pompei 's citiziens .
I love the overnight tour , in which only fires light the ruins .
There is an unique athmosphere !
In my opinion anyone could n't come to Italy without visiting Pompei .
If you come , I promise you 'll never forget it !
I do n't think there is no future for public transport .
Especially in urban , for example , Taipei city in Taiwan .
People who lives there almost know the convenient public transport called MRT , it 's fast , cheaper and does n't have to find the parking lot .
Besides , it 's harmful and makes earth environment more worse for emission so much carbon dioxide .
That will cause the global warming .
So , it is better to use public transport .
But , if you live in the country , car may be essential , because it 's will spend so much money to buy the tickets if their family have many people .
So , I think the government should have to draw a proposal to solve the problems between the use for urban and counry .
And think deeply the problem about protecting the environment .
I love my small family .
My family members are very helpful and supportive .
My parents are very support .
My parents are my best friends and guides .
If any problems faced , i 'm went to my parents and say the problem , there are solve the problem .
My family is my world .
My parents are the good guides .
There are my role model.some times we were go to the tour programs , it 's very happy moments .
My mammy told the story in night .
Mom make the special foods in festivals .
my family is a nuclear family .
My family is great .
Steve Ramsay work in the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D and live in Washington D.C. after the Battle of New York .
Someday , an S.H.I.E.L.D. 's agent was attacked by the ghost .
After that Steve become an America captain to protect the world again .
But he does n't know he is involved in a conspiracy .
He meets a strong opponent who is winter soldier when he wants to find out the wirepuller .
Walking every day is what I enjoy .
Besides to be an excellent exercise , is also the more comfortable , because it allows me to concentrate , to be with myself , talking and praying to God in each step in the morning .
I woke up 5H00 o'clock in the morning ,
I consider this is the best time to do sport , taking into account that the pollution is down at that time .
There is not so much traffic , and my senses and lounges perceive and respire all the smell that flowers , land , the First , I walk slowly and then I begin to walk as soon as possible to improve my fitness and I end walking 5 turns in the park .
What I really enjoy it is to lie in the grass .
It is in this moment when I get to talk to God .
I feel that he is near to me that he listens to me every word that I pray .
Doing so , I begin my routine day , come back home , begin to do my breakfast , followed by the lunch , because I have to get to work at 9H00 o'clock .
It is an activity that goes according to the capacity of each one , that doing it each morning improvement our health and move away all the bad of our body .
The graph below gives information about seasonal sales for ice - cream of different places in ice cream van and indoor swimming pool in Jan to Dec .
Overall , average of 5000 dollars of year about ice cream van .
In addition , indoor swimming pool sales have a slightly declining from 2012 to 2014 .
First , the graph showed an upward trend to ice cream van , and in 2014,it has the largest percentage of sales nearly 5500 dollars in Jul - Sep .
No matter what year , its lowest level always in Jan - Mar .
May be because this paragraph of time the weather was cold , the purchaser greatly reduced .
We can be seen from the diagram , the highest peak in the has increased year by year , as the low as .
Second , for indoor swimming pool , it generally appear wavy falling , from 2500 dollars in 2012 to 2000 dollars in 2014 . We can infer , it will not rise sharply , and it is impossible to fall sharply .
Most people like to have their own car , because they think is more comfortable and flex .
You can go out from your house and take your car park and leave to your job and park very close .
But I think that the future is the public transport , we need preserve nature , this is an imperative for our world , then the solution have to take the point that the governments do more invest in public transport , so the people do n't need to get a car for being able to have a job and do n't need it for normal development of their lives .
As well , we have to promote that the people get jobs close their accommodation or get the accommodation close to the jobs , because we have too much pollution and we could reward the companies that hire staff close to the place of job , maybe in a circle of 4 kilometres , as well we could reward the people that turn their accommodation for live near to the job or for going there by a bicycle .
Maybe this sound a bit crazy , but whatever solution will be good , we only must make our minds up for able to look across .
What the fine weather today !
What a fine day !
It 's April now , and spring is finally .
The sun shines bright , snow has melted in the March .
Birds returned from warm countries .
They sing joyfully and build the nests .
People look happier .
They feel tired after long snowy winter .
In the March we set forward our watch an hour ago .
Summertime was first converted in 1900 year .
Days are getting longer but night are getting shorter and lighter .
We convert our watches an hour ago in October .
It 's pleased some people because they will be able to sleep an hour more .
I like spring and always wait for it and wait for summer holidays with impatience .
Summer is really little life .
As soon as I pass all exams I will travel .
As they say in English proverb < travel broadens the mind>. In summer you can switch off of daily routine , relax , have a talk with friends .
I did n't decide as yet where I will spend the summer .
It became a big problem now .
I always want to see the world , to swim in the Ocean .
However I am stopped last tragic developments in foreign countries .
I think , it 's better and safer to go to Black sea , to Crimea or to Kuakas .
My friends have bought ticket to Sochi yet .
It 's the best , the most beautiful and the most comfortable resort in the South .
It 's possible , I will join them , because I have never been in Sochi and everyone should visit this wonder city one time of their life .
What is my favorite sport ?
Well , I 've played martial arts .
I 've been doing that for around twenty years .
Some martial arts are not really sports .
They 're more for self - defense but for what I do , and my way to stay healthy , is martial arts and running .
As far as watching , that 's a good question .
I would suppose I would have to say , in Japan Sumo is my favorite sport for watching .
I 've never tried it myself .
I would have to probably be three times as big as I am to even begin to qualify for something like that but , yeah , I enjoy watching it a lot .
I have to start saying that I never imagine swimming like my favorite sport , because until my back 's injury , I practiced other sports , I most like extreme sports like downhill , skateboarding martial arts like Aikido , jiujitsu or ninjutsu , but for my injury I have to start swimming and now I love it .
The think because I enjoy these sport is I feel free when I am in the water , it is so relaxing and I red it is the most completely sport because you work the whole body .
If you want to start swimming I think you should looking for a swimming teacher because if ca n't swim , you must need it , and if you can swim but not well , if you are not on practice and know your swim style is not the best I recommend you a professional assistance .
More time that you do n't have that assistance is going to be more difficult improve your style and enjoy swimming more because if you really know how to swim are going to have more resistance in the water .
Last week was a hard week for my wife .
She works at a language school in local University .
It is just the beginning of winter vacation courses , so she has been struggled with a lot of work and students .
I think , that may the reason she had the Sleep Paralysis last night .
In Korea , we call it ' Ka - Wee - Nool - Rim ' which means being pressed by ' Ka - wee ' ghost .
Yes , she actually felt as if someone was pressing down on her chest by hands .
Even she was not able to lift single finger tip as if she was turned into a stone statue .
She opened her eyes .
Then , she realized that four indistinct strangers were staring at her as standing just beside bed .
She was so scared and frightened .
She tried screaming and calling me who was sleeping peacefully beside at her .
But she could n't .
She could n't open mouth , say anything at all .
Even worse , two of them started whispering on her ears , die … die ..
Well , actually it did n't happen .
She just dreamed a terrible nightmare because I was not sleeping .
I was watching a YouTube clip by my iPad .
She reproached me for not awaking her up despite she had been calling me so eagerly .
But it is not true .
She had n't called me at all .
It was just a dream , very real like .
Most of those dreamers claim that it is like real .
They think they really opened eyes and awaken since it is too vivid and detailed .
Often they explains and describe the scene in detail like a cup on table , friends who watching TV beside them , room light and so on .
But nothing is real . They realize that no cup is on table , no one is at room , and the light is off .
Commonly , the dreamers say that they ;
- experience when they are so tired physically and so stressed .
- feel drowning down when they are about falling in sleep(so they know it will happen )
- feel a lot of press on body and can not move in dream .
- see someone or some people as standing beside or riding on them .
- feel the dream is so vivid and real .
- repeatedly dream again if they rarely awake themselves .
Some experience so easily and often .
Most scary case I heard is that the ghost pulled hair into under bed as stabbing chest with a sharp gimlet .
Luckily , I have never dreamed it .

He picked up the keys and came out fast the home .
By the time he was going down the stairs from the fourth floor his neighbour Mary stopped him .
Peter was very worried .
He needed to arrive at the Train Station on time .
Despite the urgency of taking the train on time .
He was kind and spoke with Mary .
The widow woman who was very nice gave a present for Peter .
The young Polish very grateful replied to the woman : " Thank you , it hasn't to make any present "
Mary smiled to Peter and said:"You are welcome , now , you have to enjoy your family .

Peter looked at his watch and knew that he has to do something immediatele .
He had forggoten to go to his English classes .
It was half past seven and her class begun fifteen minutes ago .
Last week her mother told her that he had to go to his classes if he wanted to hang out with his friends .
He already knew that he was late but he could not go now , so he decided to cheat her mother .
He did homework from his books so his mother might believe it .
But he did not realise something , His little brother was watching him througt the window .
When her mother came back from work , her little son told her what his brother had done .
She was very angry and she could not believe that her son did that .
After that Peter did not hang out for three months , so he can learn the lesson , You must not lie or cheat to your mother .
I think that the public transport always going to be so important in our life because not all the people have the possibility to buy a car because the public transport is more expensive than a car , so for that reason the public transport in the future could be exist , because public transport is a necesity in all the world not only for the money but too for the facility to take a bus or any other public transport
Yesterday I went to the Ulster Museum in Botanic Gardens at 2 pm .
I went to nature section , which is interesting as it is about natural aspects on earth like elements , rocks and periods of life related to organisms .
The section was big and it had a lot of information in a scientific manner , some section had complete information part while other had not .
Beginning in one of the complete parts that I preferred and liked I 'm going to write about the Ice age .
It was a period of time in earth 's history when temperatures fell globally , causing ice sheets and glaciers to form far from the north and south pole .
¿ What did you learn about debates ?
Mel , who was a teacher for young people .
Teach about a debates .
How be a good debaters .
He uses a rule for debates : preposition+ result = positive or negative ( Why )
Every debate has a hot spot .
Hot spot is a place where the debaters can explain the idea .
Hot spot helps to get more security .
Always infront on your public .
The result depend : security , volume in the voice , body posture and public .
The main idea is keep the body , take the mind .
The great debaters , have to believe in your idea .
Does n't matter the idea , only the arguments .
I do n't know is n't anwer .
An Important deal , is never quit .
Always fight if you want .
Debates is a combat
Peter has just got out by school and he realized that he 's overdue for his weekly guitar lesson .
But before the lesson , he has to lunch with his family and leading the dog from the veterinary for his annual vaccine .
Peter gets a fast lunch in ten minutes , other two minutes for finding the bike and putting the dog on the basket ; at the office of the veterinary three people wait , so Peter is forced to wait .
After an hour the dog is vaccined and taken at home , but her mother needs a milk bottle .
Unfortunately Anne , her sister , has just taken the bike , so he 's forced to walk until the nearest supermarket .
Peter 's mother needs a special kind of milk without lactose , and the market behind home does n't have it .
So Peter had to make a choice : going at the lesson or waiting his father for getting to take the milk with the car ?
After an exhausting afternoon , Peter has a bit of luck , infact his father Jack has just came back from the work , so he could get to take the milk and giving him a passage .
With a little delay , but Peter did it !

I am a young women with a melancoly 's character .
I am an introvert too .
I have many problem with my speaking skill .
if stay of the public and want to do presentation , I always get nervous .
I do nt know why , it 's always accur to me .

I love bwrite but I not confidance with my grammar .
I do many mistake in every story I already right down . the wrong tense I used .
I call this mistake with " Du " .
Why " du ? " . yeah ..
because I love used this word .
I have no idea after this sentense .
An excessive amount of cars on the road is not an option as this could cause problems in most metropolitan areas .
There would be a tremendous amount of pollution and traffic jams .
As the population grows , you will an increasing problem .
Thereore , public transportation is the future and more and more people will be using the metro , publis buses etc .
Cars are not good .
They have pollution .
But they go fast .
Cars are red .

Sport is the activity that help the people at have an optimal physical .
I think that sport is important for discipline in life .
My favourite sport is football , it is a complete sport , there are aggression , mentality and fun .
my favourite football club is Napoli , it is the heart club , for this team I feel indescribable emotions ... when I see my team , I smile in moments of joy , I cry in moments of sadness and suffering and rejoice when they score and win the game .
i advice at all people that want start sport of they do begin , because this sport helps to grow and mature .
work in your own company is very challenging because you deal with a lot of areas , manage all departments and learn about busines , management , economics , sales , engineering , tecnical support and other skills .
you are responsible for your workers and the customer satisfaccion , However is very satisfying to see how your own company is grow up and your customers return again because they loved your job .
that work looks depressing , demanding and stressful but is very rewarding and if you like the challenges you never will bored
Dear Friend
hope you are fine , kindly be know that I miss you so much and I hope to see you soon .
I 'm very happy to know that you want to come to Egypt and work in it .
Here are some tips about the Egyptian people
they are so kind , friendly , stressed but have a lot of problems now days the level of poverty , standard of level , the fixed cost is increasing dramatically and the purchasing power is decreasing .
The salary or the income in Egypt does not match with this increase or this inflation .
So if you want to work in Egypt you must have a complete information about the job ( location , salary , incentives , Allowances , work environment , position titles , company type , policy , mission , vision )

Military service is people who is forced by the government be a part of the army to serve and protect the country .
There are many countries which should be complete the military service when people who reach 18 such as Taiwan , South Korea and Singapore .
The duration of the military service should be around 12 mouths to 20 mouths .
Also , there are different sections of training during the military service people generally do a lot of training to their obedience or how to use the weapons .
Thus , there is a cause of agreement and another cause of disagreement which is freedom of choice and mental maturity .
As this topic , the one of the reason of everyone should not have to complete the military service because the freedom of choice .
Some people may think it seem to be a human rights that let the people to choose if they want to join the military .
Otherwise , when the people are forced by the government , they probably feel the freedom of choice is restricted .
So some counties would not force the people to join military .
In contrast , it could be the benefit that improves their mental maturity .
If people join the military service when they just 18 , it may learn a lot of life skills as there are quite a high claim in the military and the chancellor who work in the military may request to the soldiers that everything frequently be regular .
For instance , they usually need them to fold up a quilt in a specified angle or there is specific time that you must wake up and get sleep .
People should not be complaining about anything even if they seem to be right .
But after a period of time , people could develop their obedience especially to the young people ; they will be likely to become a more independent person .
To conclude with both sides , there are reasons to effect by people should or should not have to complete military service .
However ; the effects may different which is base on how length of the duration .
Hi mum and dad
Today I had a trip to a museum and an art gallery with my school .
The museum and the art gallery located in the capital city .
The museum is huge and beautiful .
I really like antiques even though it is not much to look at .
The art gallery is nice too .
They have some paintings of Leonardo da Vinci which is really impress me .
My favourite part is listened to a guide introduce to panting art .
I ca n't wait to back home and tell you more about the trip .
Love from your son :) .
Thanh .
In my city , we have not a regular care for the environment .
There have been many projects to improve the caring of the environment .
But there is a big problem : the people 's culture .
In my country you can do a lot of efforts to take care of the environment , but the bad culture in our people is a great problem .
That is because we do n't demonstrate interest in the problems of others .
We think that our authorities are responsible for these themes .
Then , we do n't take positive actions , individually .
We just wait until others clean the streets .
The people put their rubbish in bags and threw it away near their houses .
They do n't spend money in a good container .
Then , the dogs can break the bags and eat the rubbish .
In this way the streets are always dirty .
In my case , I prefer to have a clean Street .
It does n't matter if I lose time putting the bags with rubbish in a good container .
If everyone 's demonstrate a better culture , it is possible to improve our environment .
Nowadays we grow up with the possibility of choosing a lot of sports .
This fact allows young people do exercise and enjoy at the same time .
Do team sports also help to meet other people and make new friends .
Favorite sport of many people is football , instead of my favorite is basketball .
I started to play it when I was twuelve years old and currently I still love this sport .
My main reason for love it is how you feel when play a match and finally your team win .
Also , I known great friends who play basketball .
Every sport focus on some parts of the body , however basketball is the most complete sport .
It is true that basketball require a lot of physical activity , but a good mental attitude is very important .
You ca n't be disappointed because you do n't get any point or have a bad day , due to the other players can sympathise with you .
If it happen , you will continue doing the best as you can .
To reach this , I recommend do exercise three times a week and follow a healthy diet .
Adolescent has always been the hardest part throughout anybody 's whole life ..
turning out in a fleeting glimpse into an adult , perceiving the other side of life , how tough and complicated it is , trying to deal with its different circumstances ..
at this point you merely have a brief look at your whole life , many questions spinning in your head , accusing yourself of being a lost cause , wishing if you could turn the clock back,,but it 's all no good ..
then you find yourself standing ahead clouds of reality , which sucks ..
life is stages , this stage of your life is timeless , no way out ..
at some point you wish if it was all illusio , you need a time machine makes it possible to go back in time when you could see the purity of life ..
However .. here you are completely different made of life lessons , preferring to make a stiff upper lip .. cowering in your own reality .
Yes , television entertains , but it can also educate .
Television can improve knowledge on current affairs .
Education does n't lie on current affairs or related concepts .
Television helps us to find the fields that interests us , like music , sports , movies or nature .
These days television allows us to see happenings all around the world .
However , there are quite a lot of disadvantages of television .
Especially , the fake news spreads faster without much effort .
It depends on the individual , how to make use of the opportunity .
Watching TV seems to be top on our list of things to do after a long hard days ' work with a hot cup of tea in dark winters .
TV were and are seen as entertainment channels , but have you ever questioned if they are more then just entertainment ?
Are we subconsciously educating ourselves ?
You ask how ?
Now that would be an interesting question , we can watch anything from news to cat fish the TV show , in the name of entertainment are actually learning .
The truth is we are always learning , but how we learn is another matter , there main type of learners are auditory , visual , and kinesthetic .
TV stimulates at two learning style which is visual and auditory .
Some may argue that TV just does not have sufficient content for us to be able to learn , other may argue that TV is an amazing source of learning . i.e we learn about new technology via a mobile phone advert air on TV .
We learn about social values , World news etc .
I have personally picked up information I would not have come accross other wise for example , I have be able to learn that new BMW seven series , has ambiance lighting , it can pull in and out of the garage at the touch of a button , it 's computerises system can read different road surfaces and adapt it 's drive .
so have you ever asked yourself Television entertains , but can it also educate .
The New Music
Blues , Rock n Roll , folk music were the basis for the new music .
1966 - 1967 the huge change takes place .
The 3 musics were even known in 1963 .
Every music express other feelings .
There were some people who started playing Rock songs .
And after this everybody started to change there type of music .
Electronic was born .
It made everything possible .
Than the music hanged to multi media .
And so changed the old music to the new music .
The circuit is characterised by long straights and chicanes which makes it possible to achieve high - speeds .
Drivers drive the cars with full throttle for over 75% of the lap , longer than the other circuits .
In my opinion riding at high - speed on the long straight can be cause overheating the cars engines and the can blow up .
The rugged kerbs can cause the suspension crack .
The falling leaves can be block driver 's view and block up the radiators .
I think cutting trees which around the circuit and undercutting kerbs can be reduce danger and technical problem on the track and we have to reduce long straights .
Global power and politics are now surprisingly centered to those , which have an apex maturity of science .
Addiction to authoritative nature over other makes a huge production of war weapons convert the blessing nature of science into critics .
Despite all of the assistance of science in daily life , it has not without criticism in different views .
Science replaces human labor into instrument , but what about happiness ?
There is no definition of happiness in scientism or how could it get through the scientific user manual .
Very often , it has criticized to change indigenous cultures into so - called luxurious development , contradictory to religious faith .
Science is concerned only with the information about the world whatever it is , and sometimes in unethical conclusion without considering the morality .
It occupies so pivotal a role in modern society and commands so much public money , should find itself subject to criticism from a variety of source .
But living 21st centaury , its difficult to blame science where we are benefited through its technological applications on everyday our life to an ever - great extent .
My country is pretty clean compared to the cities and countries that I know although there are a few pieces of paper or plastic on the streets , but residents have a great respect for nature .
In fact , they keep the woods clean and the owners sent the loggers to remove dead trees now or those that could lead to hazards , but every time you remove a tree , is immediately put a young plant so that the environment does not undergo changes that will lead out balance the system .
For waste management across the country , even in the countryside , they were placed the bins for recycling paper , plastic , glass and waste .
Three times a week garbage trucks pass to empty them , and once a week a garbage collector passes to clean up the streets .
Travelling by using any transport has become in one of our needs , in the past people used to take hours waiting for the public transport , now , we can afford any of those modern car at the agency .
The future of the public transport is fading away , you might ask why .
the main problem is the bad service , for example , the drivers are not careful enough to drive , that might be unsafe for the users .
another disadvantage is the unclean chairs in the transport .
Those are the main reasons that could make the public transport diseappear .
I consider the best option to buy a car so we can feel safe .
Firstly , it is a good idea for young children do physical activity that is the first step to do exercise , then to compete sports will make competitior to make an extra effort .
Also , just for young children that are in process of growth and development , physical exercise is essential to do it , because they can have a healthier life .
Young children try to effort , and wants to win at this age , and if they train results were better and encourages to keep training .
In psychic way , if you are adapated forms relations and create new friends .
In the future , adults that was able to obtain more achievements and make it more responsible , and you can have a good social life , if you competes doing sports .
In addition , stress is a clear disadvantage of compete because competitiors are trying to win and this can frustrates .
But , some people do not think this like this and take it more simply
Finally , I think that to compete in sports has some benefits and disadvantages , but when is controlated there are some benefits that help you to whole you life .
Dear sir / Madam ,
For upcoming enhancement , I would like to inform you that there was no longer the public transportation services since travel by car more convenient .
Therefore travel by car is ready by now .
Best regards ,

Shops in the town
Introduction
The aim of this report is to outline what are shopping facilities in our town and write some tips for tourists with different preferences .
Shopping facilities
Although our town is quite small , there are many variations of shops such as clothes shop , sport shops , toy shops or book shops .
Even though the shops is not large , there are remarkable goods , for example , nice running shoes or valuable books .
Possibility of the shops
All in all , the shops have a variety of goods , which can attract many tourists .
If you have a small kid , you will visit toy shops , which offer many cars and helicopters .
On the other hand , you can visit book shops whether you are pensioner and you have a lot of free time .
Conclusion
To sum up , I suppose our town offers many interesting shops .
Moreover , the goods is quite cheap .
Halloween is traditional holiday in USA but the original history came from Celtic people .
The immigrants came with this religious culture and along the time has became part of American culture .
Today this holiday is celebrated around the word and you can have fun with party or costume yourself .
The picture below illustrates how to make bank notes .

When the one side is printed , raising the images slightly to make opposite to be colored .

It is of importance to inspect the printed sheets .
If the sheet is good or partialy damaged , it can be packed and delivered by veichals after cutted in to separate notes .
Otherwise , the sheets and notes would be abandoned and destroyed in the fire .
The issue of weather there is no future for public transport is a topic that has cased an on going argument . in my topic i intent to discuss to contravening view piont in more depth .
firstly , some people believe that public transport is a significant part in our live and its more difficult to rely on our cars only .
Hi my name is Chai , i 'm from Thailand , I try to write an article to improve my writing skill and hope this program can help me .
My favorite way to travel is the Plane because I like to be fast and in my life , I hate a wait in my opinion the plane is the best for me for example when you want to go somewhere you need to reach there so quick , you do n't need to take time and The plane is the best travelling in the world that the best safer than other way , you can see on the pollution of people who got an accident , how often an accident happen by the plane so anyway if it 's happen , i ca n't imagine it , Eventually I wish everyone who like to travel is safe and sound and safe journey .
First of all Television has less viewers now days .
Most of the people turn to the Internet website or applications like Netflix or Youtube .
Now let 's go back to those days when young people still watch television for entertainment .
There were a lot of programs on television .
Most of the people watched news , movies , or tv shows on television .
Also there was a lot of different channel that we chose .
As I remember there were educational channel like Discovery and National Geography .
Those channel always content a lot of new technology .
For some people may think that only these kind of channel can provide educational knowledge and for some people they do n't consider watching these channel as entertainment .
For these kinds of channel are both entertainment and educational .
But I wo n't opine that these are the only channels that can provide knowledge .
All kinds of shows can give you all kinds of different knowledge even when you watch movies .
But of course there will be some channel that is not suitable for child under 18 or just for adult .
As I think there is no channel that you ca n't learn form it .
All kinds of programs have something that you can think about just depend on how you look at it .
So television entertains , but can it also educate ?
Yes of course but only when you look at it as a way you wanna learn something .
My studies in tecnologico de Monterrey are demanding and challenging because it has a very high educative score all worldwide , but also has to many good things , for example we have a lot of interchanges all around the world , when you have the opportunity to do an interchange you have to deal with the language and the culture with the other country , that means you have to be responsible for studying the basics things of that country , but all of this is worthwhile because when you are there you have so much fun .
I think that a complete sport is to swim for most of the people .
It 's good for health and wellness .
I really enjoy because give me a lot of relax and it help me to be tonic and satisfied myself .
Usually I go three times a week and during the weekend .
I advice peolpe to start this sport , because is completely and make you mind with the body feel very good .
When I was fourteen years old , I win the championchip because in that period I swam as agonistic atlet .
It had been a really satisfation and I had been happy .
Nowadays I 'm really grateful to my parents because they have spent money for me and I have to thanks them .
I think this sport is the most completely compared to the other sports .
Your muscles begin more efficient and tonic and you have a lot of benefits for the body .

Subject : Our green town
Introduction
The aim of the report is to write how are town take care of the environment .
I do a research and this are findings .
Rubbish
We have a lot of bins around the area , so now we can throw our litters whenever we are .
Also we have recycle bins for paper and glass .
Cleaners
Every Saturday our local cleaning team clean the park and now everyone can enjoy it !
Conclusion
We do everything to make our town more green , our citizens always have new ideas that make the difference of our daily life .
It is common that more and more people get overweight , caused by too much fastfood and unhealthy lifestyle .
Now some scientists have suggest to having warnings on some types of food and drink .
But is this idea a way to reduce the bad habit of consume noxious foodstuff ?
On the one hand I ca n't imagine that a little scine on the food people entrap to stop their shopping and read the warnings .
Life is fast moving and time is money .
Everything has to happen fast .
First of all , we need to make people aware of the current environmental situation in order to do activities that help the environment .
To begin with , we have to try to use as little as possible the car or the bus and try to get at any place walking or by bicycle .
This action would decrease the gas emitted to the environment .
In addition , the water issue is another big problem .
Nowadays , people is wasting water instead of saving it .
One basic solution for this point is try to not take a shower for so much time but taking it with a bucket and a few minutes .
Another solution is to not waste water while we are washing dishes .
We should use another bucket for this task .
Talking about rubbish , it is very important to separate it in the following types : metal , plastic , organic , glass and cardboard in order to make the collection task easy for the dustman .
However , we also have to try to not create more rubbish recycling most of them .
For example , the organic rubbish can be used as fertilizer , the metal scrap can be taken to the melting factory as well as the glass .
Therefore , the environment is not going to recover if we do not decide to take our part in this global problem .

Public transport is and always will be very important for society .
As we 've seen these days that the amount of cars is increasing so much every year .
As a consequence of an increasing in number of private cars .
Governments around the world have talking a lot about the measures should be taken to improve public transport quality .
No doubts travelling by car is pretty much better than go by public bus .
although Louis felt nervous , she realised this was the opportunity of a lifetime .
I was manager at retail store .
Everyday work stressed me and by the end of my shift I get so tired .
I decided to go back to school .
The program I start at school was very tough for me , because my slow English writing .
I do not have very good english writing skill .
My grammar and spellings are week .
I am struggling in school .
I am trying my best hope I will pass my course and get a good job .

The future transport is the public , because the traffic it will be less .
When the people travel by car is for work , holidays or for other motive .
We should use the less car , it is very pollutant .
I will start with old transport , if we did n't make any maintenance this type will be damaged and lose it .
In the future , every person will use his car and no need for public transport.this type of transport have a path and just take you for specific places and you ca n't use it to go to small streets .
But in some country , You can use underground ( metro ) , it is very advanced than old types like Bus or Taxi , The underground is faster and clean and arranged .
About pollution , it is a big issue in public transport , with time if you try to fix the machine of public transport that will be coste , because with time the live age of this machine will finish .
Michael is a man of 22 years , he has studied the career of electricity engenieer and now he wants to put into practice his knowledge .
He went to buy a newspaper to search for a job , he was looking all the advertisements but he never found the one he nedded .
Michael though that it was time to do something .
He could not be at home all day doing such nothing so he started to look for another job that would be suitable for him .
When he was a kid he wanted to work in a videogames shop so for his good luck it was available a job at Play Station store .
Of course he does not think twice and go for print his curriculum because the interview was that day , then he took a shower and dress for the occasion .
He prepared something to eat fast , brushed his teeth , he just took his mobile , keys and money but he had n't noticed that he was forgetting of his curriculum .
However , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
My favourite sport is soccer .
It is an interesting activity!There is Fifa world cup too !
There are some soccer stars like Messi , Neymar , Ronaldo ...... Soccer can make you healthier .
There are soccer lessons .I have joined the lesson .
First , the teacher will train us soccer technique .
Next , we will have a soccer competition .
But we will break our legs .
We need to be careful .
Soccer is an interesting sport but we need to be careful .
My father is 73 years old , his name is Brahim .
He is tall and smart he looks like a movie star .
My father has many hobbies , he plays foot ball , reads newspaper and listens to Radio .
In my opinion , family is more important than friends , but probably I spent more time with my friends than family . I know if I need something my family is always there .
The difficult is that you rarely know if your best friend is a true friend .
Unfortunately , my best friend deceived me , I do n't know how she managed but she hurts me .
My cousins are very reliable like my grandmother and my parents .
The family has a link blood therefore you have a natural empathy .
For all rules have exceptions .
I do n't trust in some members of my family and I have friends like brothers .
You need to discovered who is your best friends . Lifelong you will learn who is who .
For me , my best friends are in my family , except one .
She
grown up with me and now she is my sister too .
My city is Jaén it 's in the east of Andalucia and is an important cross ways between the south and center os Spain .
So an important historical place is the St. Katherine 's castle .
This is an old castle of 10th century and the style is Arabian .
It 's over a high hill with difficult slopes to arrive because the most important property is it impregnable .
In the reconquest age the stronghold never downfall with a direct assault , finally the Castellan 's army after a large siege force to the government surrender it .
Then in the 18th century the Napoleonic army lived in it until the end of independence Spanish war .
The French army before came back to France destroyed it .
Actually the castle has been restored and has a historic museum , also have a great hotel with four stars for tourists .
I like this place because I can enjoy a good views to my city .
I prepare class every day .
I try to do all the activities in class .
I do n't have enough time to practise and do activities at home .
I need to speak and participate more in class .
We speak most of the time , so it is good to develop our confidence and fluency to converse .
plane , train , and boat are the ways to travel .
I think the boat is the best way to travel and I have three reasons for my idea .
First of all , boat moves across the sea and the sea is very beautiful .
For instance , when we move on the sea , we can see many types of animals , such as birds , turtles , and fishes .
Next , the boat usually is very big , so we can do many activities on it , such as dancing , drinking .
Finally , It is the safest way for travel , because we do not have many dangers , such as crashing , falling any other kinds of danger in the sea .
Therefore , I prefer the boat to travel , instead of the train or the plane .
All in all , travel in the sea with a boat can be very interesting and comfortable , in addition , it is very safety .
I advise you to travel by boat if you have enough money for it .
Have you ever practised rafting?Do you know how amazing is to do this cool sport?If you do n't know nothing about it , it 's high time to do it !
I had n't never heard about doing rafting until my best friend , Carmen , told me whether I wanted to have a whale of a time with her and I accepted it .
Therefore , we went to join in a sports centre which take over organising this stunning outdoor activity .
Rafting get you burn all your adrenaline whereas you try to get down over the river in a mini - boat .
It 's extremely exciting !
In addition , you 'll enjoy a breathtaking landscapes around you and you 'll also see a vast range of wildlife in both sides of the river .
Nevertheless , I would recommend you to wear appropriate clothes and to bring protection cream with you .
In contrast , you could suffer some nasty cuts or , even though , being sunburnst .
Let 's go !
Do not hesitate taking up rafting !
You wo n't regret !
My life now
In my life I have had a big experiences that have made me change and mature .
One of the most important experience I think was coming to study to Tijuana .
It was a really challenge for me to live alone .
Before I came here I was so dependent of my parents and I had a lot of fear , but I learned to overcome all the things that stopped me .
When I was child I used to live in Tijuana .
I was born here .
When I had 4 years I went to live to Ensenada because my father worked there .
I was used to living with my whole family in Ensenada .
Since I was born to my 18 years old I was living whit them , but now I live in a small apartment .
I am studying Nutrition at the University , that is why I am living in Tijuana .
I used to live in assistent house it was my first place where I lived in Tijuana , then I changed to an aparment with two friends .
All weekends I used going to Ensenada for visiting my family , my boyfriend and my fiends .
Before I came to live to Tijuana , I was really nervous because I had to leave everything and because it would be a change in my life .
For summit , came to live to Tijuana was a really challenged for me .
I learned that you need to face your fears , to achieve your goals .
I do not regret what I did because I do what I like .
Now I am so independent and I learned how to live alone .
I live in a small village on countryside with few people .
Even if we are a country , we take care of the environment through the use of photovoltaic systems on roofs of many houses , such as the nursery school and other houses that have this systems to produce energy .
We separated paper from glass and also to plastic .
The garbage picks up paper once a week , plastic two times at month and undiferretiated three times a week to all people who live in my country .
My district makes clean my village and it usually tries to make attractive with new social initiatives for the community .
All people of the world have friends , I 'm not an exception .
When I was 10 years old I met my best friend .
We 're friends since we start to talk , but our friendship has change over the time .
When we were 12 we played in the garden with the balls and with the other boys and girls , but when we were 12 years everything changes we do n't want to play in the garden because we preferred cinema or watching TV .
Because of age changing we did n't see us , but in the moment that we grew up more , we met us the weekends and sometimes we 're upset about some problems that we had .
With the time we are more friends .
Now , we discuss sometimes but we love us because he always stay together in the good moments to take a coffee or talk about our lives , but he also stay in the bad moments , despite being friends since we were 10 years old .
For this reason I think that friendship is so important thing in the life .
I think the opposite , I believe that public transportation has a really huge future .
It is true that we are a lot of users that want to use the car but , and that amount is growing up ; as well there are a lot of people that do n't have the posibility to have a car and some use the public transportation because many reasons like the price , because it is easier to get to the place by public transportation rather than car , because the traffic , some times for people it is so exhausting to drive lots of hours an even some times the public transportation is faster .
The population is growing up so fast , we need public transportation , is important .
Public Transportation is convenient for some people and some people think is more convenient the car , finally we will need public transportation on the future .
In our opinion globalization is a good thing that happen to us , allow us to interact with all the world , so we can meet the cultures , monuments , etc .
It bring us a lot of opportunities to change and in some cases to get a better life in other countries like find a job with the highest salary .
Although we need to change some things in the world , more than these is to change a lot of things in the third world countries , because it is not acceptable that in the twenty - first century a person live with less than a dollar per day .
Dear Molly ,
I 'm writing of my summer job at the Cinema .
it was very beautiful , because I can see much films free and I meet all the young people of my country .
In the morning I walk around the cinema and the most important place of my country and I talk about the films that the people can watch .
they do more questions and I very funny for this .
I could n't buy the tickets of the film 's cinema but I could do more discount all my friends !
I hope that you are funny like me .
They pay me a lot of money and I can buy a lot of dress , jeans , shoes , book and make - up .
I see the new film of Disney " Inside out " and I eat much pop corn !
I cry a lot for this film but it 's very important for me because I love disney 's film .

First at all , this is a report that will explain how the village of Vancouver is handle their rubbish material .
Firstly , the city of Vancouver has a programme called go green Vancouver that it will protect the environment selecting the rubbish by containers at the same time there is a collaboration from the city hall of any district that it will provided a 3 containers for each house one for papers one for bottles y the last one for rubbish materials .
Secondly , there is a programme with the water company to cut on spends of the water by 50 % using a recycle water treatment and recirculating to the house without dumping the wasten and saving our planet .
Finally , every city hall is improving the care of the environment because there is an incentive programmes from the goverment like if they cut the spends of every house by 50 % city halls get more money from the central government .
I strongly believe that grammar is not the most important element to speak English , if you know grammar you only know certain rules to write , but I think that speaking is most important than writing , because when you go to anyplace in the world , you have to be prepared to talk and understand whatever they say to you ; in this part you may notice that if you do n't know vocabulary , you would n't unsderstand anything ; but here is another topic , whether you understand or not , you have to notice the way that people talk to you , and try to realize what the person is trying to say .
According to your e - mail , we discovered the price should be USD 122 instead of 222 .
Please be advised that the right amount on the settlement date .
Awaiting for your amendment as soon as possible .
Ride bicycle is my favourite sport .
It helps me healthy .
It leep me positive mood .
I can seen much scenery in short times . I can buy goods along the road .
Buy a good bike is the first when you start to ride .
Once or twice on a week to ride .
It can Avoid catch cold .
It is clear that technology has provided us with several options in communication .
Perhaps the clearest example of this is that unlike the past , it is not necessary to buy envelops and stamps to send the letter .
Instead , people prefer to email or text to send messages .
Another way this change is evident is that social networking or applications such as Skype , FaceTime and Facebook are widely used to stay in touch with their family , friends and relatives
My favourite sport is basketball .
This sport is very easy to play .
You need to play it on team .
You need to have ability to play it .
This sport is about you catch the ball and score .
You do exercise to be strong and have ability in your legs and your hands .
I enojoy this because I like it .
I love this sport .
In some cases you could have an accidents , but that 's not probably .
When I 'm playing this sport I have a great moments and I learn more and I will have more experience in a future .
It does n't difficult and you can start to play .
All the people can do this sport .
Basketball is recognize to people in the world .

The members of my family are my best friends .
Because we spend a lot of time together .
And there is a good communication between us .
In my opinion , every family must have a good communication . Because I think , communication is one of the most important things in our life .
We use communication every time .
Because people have to use many communication techniques to communicate with other people .
However , the families that haven't a good communication haven't a good life .
If we want to have a good life , we must make good communication in our families
Hi !
My name is Anton .
I live in the one of the most beautiful countries - Ukrane .
When I was at school my friends and I attended unior swimming school .
I was 30 years before .
I used to have training twice a week .
I liked that time a lot .
My friend and I always had ice creame and fun after training .
Now I 'm a business analyst .
I work at office and have no ideas where are my friends .
This year I decided to star visiting pool and swim up to three times a week .
Now , when I swim at the open pool , I am overfilled by positive emotions .
I like swimming a lot .
Nowadays the obtion of broaden the ming traveling is very commun .
In my opinion I think that it is not the only way but it is the best way .
Apart from that you see new places and you have fun , you also lern others cultures , historicals facts , you also lern to respect others peoples and thirs costums .
In addition you do n't think in yours problems and the only thnig that you do is have fun and do what you whant to do .
Besides you see new world and thirs form of lives and that helps to open you mind , see the world in other way .
In conclussion I think that it is the best way to opemn your mindn not the only way but yes the best way .
many countries are truly started to concern no environment and worried about the globe warming , In schools teachers are doing their best to educate children how to take care of their schools and keep them tidy , also they train them how to plant trees in public gardens of their towns ,
Although government strict so many laws and taxes in the people how do not pay their taxes to the council for cleaning of the rubbish from towns and villages , in the biggest polluted city in the world people started to use bicycles and cycling instead of driving their cars to reduce the pollution of their city , also they invented different ways to plant even every little area which can be planted to keep their city clean and attractive .
First of all , I disagree with that statement , because of these reasons I am about to give .
Once we stop using Public transport , it is going to causes problems .
For example , if we completely relaying to use cars it is going to increase the gasoline uses .
Apparently it is going to make more pollution more global warming issue .
How ever , using cars makes the life easier but when everyone or every house they will own at least three cars it is too much .
Although the traffic jams the accidents etc .. .
public transport it is really important and it has a lot of advantages for helping humanity .
In my opinion every country they should have different kind of public transport
buses , subways , and trains .
For instance San Francisco it is a great example for incredible city , the variety of choices in the public transport it is remarkable .
In spite of the cost of these facilities it is going be expensive but it is necessary .
In conclusion , The governments should work on that because the people need the public transport and the world for the environment , life expanses it is much cheaper than having a car .
I hope to see it around the world , public trans port something we can not avoid or replace with another thing .
In the future , public transport will disappear .
Everyone will have his own car .
Cars will be safer and speeder than now .
Traveling by car will be the best suitable
way to move from place to another .
Recommend to friends what country we have to go .
I would like to recoomand friends to visit Italy .
first of all , nowadays wherever we go we can find Italian restaurant easily .
There are a lot of food all over the world .
but I think Italian restaurant is getting famous .
Second , beautiful tourist places like a Venice .
I have been to Italy when I was 20 .
It was awesome .
There is no word to explain .
Venice is city that is based on water .
There are no car , no metro in Venice .
On the other hand it could be complicated . but nobody complaint .
I think that 's why this city can maintain the safe environment .
Third , Italy is famous for fashion .
It brings many fashionable people .
if you are person who love fashion you will enjoy going there .
The last thing is history .
This country has a lot of history .
so it makes me exciting .
so if you want to visit any country i 'm going to recoomend to Italy .
The biggest anecdote , that I have with my friend , was our trip to Disney world .
Where we could visit all the parks of Disney , like Animal Kingdom , Hollywood studios and Magic kingdom .
In adittion we could visit others parks , like Universal and Bush Garden .
But this is not the end of our trip , we went on a voyage in a Royal Caribean cruise , where all the food and drink was free , because it was also paid .
During the voyage , we disembarked in the Bahamas and CoCo kay , which is a private island of the cruise , we went to the beach and played so many games .
To sum up , this trip was the best experience we have in our lives , because we make friends , visit a new country and we have a lot of fun .

Dear Sir ,
I 'm writing on behalf of Mrs Renata Barczak .
30th October works for Renata to meet in Berlin .
I checked connection between Warsaw and Berlin and she might be at 11.10 at Berlin Ostbf station .
Is it possible to arrange a meeting near this station ?
I think in future is n't necessary to use the public transport and why ?
Simple , the new generation decided do take your driving licence and I saw this around me , my colleagues , my friends , my family .
It 's just a question of time when everybody will have a car .
This afirmation : travelling by car is so much more convenient say everything , for example if we think a lot of time we spent on wait bus to arrive our destiny , the traffic is a lot of things that everyone prefer buy car it more practical and fast .
Do n't forget the cust .
In my opinion the price of the ticket on bus is expensive .
Every year the price of public transport turn it up .
We can stop and do a mental arithmetic and we can see a lot of many we spend one year .
If we have a car I believe we do n't spend much money .
It 's just my opinion because this is my life so I now what I am talking about .
Every months a buy my pass for use on the bus .
I am part of the new generation where in future use car and the public transport are disappear .
Hi Isabel ,
How are you ?
Where are you from ?
I 'm from Italy , I live in Varese a beautiful town not far from Milan in Lombardia .
Varese has many attractions between which the lake , where I like to stay .
My favourite place in the town is Estensi gardens , where I go to walk with my friends during the afternoon .
Michael is a nice boy but one day he met Julia .
Julia is a pretty girl .
They spent time together and were very happy .
But Michael sometimes has problem .
He is proud , it 's not a good way .
On Saturday they fighted and Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
public transport is important for anyone .
The people should walk more than before .
That makes them healthy .
Nowadays , many accident happened when they were driving their car .
They are going to travel around all over the world by plane .
the young people feel happy more .
In the argument , the author asserted that the city should prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza .
The author claimed that the business dropping causes by the increasing number of skateboarded users .
Likewise , the skateboarded users brought numerous garbage that affects the stores in the plaza .
Based on author 's two concern , the statement that drew a conclusion to prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza is not a thoughtful and wise decision .
First of all , it is a contradiction in the argument .
If more skateboarded users are willing to go to Central Plaza , there are more customers to help the growth of business .
It is against author 's assertion .
From this point view , the decreasing of business should cause by other factors , but not skateboarded users .
However , there are many reasons can cause the business dropping .
Probably , the stores are too old in Central Plaza which could not attract customers walk into , and have to renovate .
Furthermore , the produce sales in the stores that could n't fit customers ' need .
Those above reasons could influence the business in Central Plaza directly .
Second , author claimed that the sanitation problem caused by skateboarded users is not only happen by specific person , whenever more customers should bring more waste and wrongdoing .
Those problems appeal that there are not sufficient securities in Central Plaza .
Moreover , the problem would case by skateboarding immediately is the skateboarded users take over pedestrian walking space .
To solve this problem , the city should set up more space and facilities for skateboarding , and divide the different space for walking and skateboarding .
To sum it up , the author 's prediction wo n't happen if the city prohibits skateboarding .
In contact author 's concerns , the increasing skateboarded users would bring more potential to improve the business in Central Plaza .
On the other hand , the author should provide profound discussion why people come to Central Plaza do n't shop there .
The condition of the stores and safety are two crucial factors to affect the business in the plaza .
To strengthen author 's conclusion , the author should put the factors above in the argument .
I have big family consists of three sisters and one brother .
but when comparing my family with my father 's family .
I do n't feel that . because he has five sisters and three brother .
when my sisters are married they have one or tow children at most .I think the Egyption family became simller with the passage of time
The cocaine it 's the most dangerous addiction .
Firstly , cocaine damage your senses and your mind , if you consume cocaine , you wo n't sleep this day .
Secondly , it 's so addictive , because the body need more and more , so if you consumed cocaine , you would leave because you 'll an addict .
Finally , the consecuense of cocaine are the dead , if you sniff all the time cocaine or a lot , you die early .
In conclusion , cocaine it 's the most dangerous addiction , because you die early and your body it 's destroyed with the cocaine .
Oh , cool ! I haven't watched BH6 yet u.u
Yeah , fist time is ok .
But if you want I see some work in special , feel free to show me via note or mention ^^
There is an increasing trend of personal transport so that public transport will be reduced in the future .
ultimately public transport would be negligible in future .
there are so many reasons that could be affected to public transport system .
the main one is , nowadays people are dead busy with their day to day life so that they do n't like to spend their valuable time for waiting on the way for the regular transport . also public transport is experienced lots of pollution which is harmful for human being .
for example , lunch time travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emission of carbon mono oxide which is effected to red blood cells and irritate to breathing system . as a result , they prefer personal transport system for prevent from such hazards .
finally public transport system is not safe as always .
to illustrate , If teenage girls travel by public transport every day who will interact with society beyond the limitation.so it is a big challenge to them .
To who ever it goes ,
I am writing this e - mail because we want to hire your company to do the accounting of our company .
Principally , we need to have the Financial States , so we need them as fast as you can because if not we would have legal problems .

Also if it is the case I would like to arrange meeting to give you all the documents you need .
I am expecting your answer .
Sincerely , Tania Amado .

The graph shows the seasonal sales of ice - cream in two places - one is from an ice - cream while the other is in an indoor public swimming pool , from 2012 to 2014 .
The line which represent the indoor swimming pool remain fairly steady , from approximately 1800 to 2500,the period of every year from April to June and October to December own the highest outstanding achievement , whilst the sale is downwards overall .
However , compared to the line of indoor swimming pool , the difference of seasonal achievement of ice cream van is considerably large .
Overall , the achievement of ice cream van is better than the indoor swimming pool , from about 1100 to 5500 .
The best season to sale the ice cream from the van is autumn , while that is one of the worst season for indoor swimming pool .
The discrepancy of these two place is large .
The best sale achievement of the van is 4500,5000,5500respectively .
One day many years ago in something place that a do n't remember the name I woke up one morning more earlier than usual then I went to the kitchen and shout the name of my mother ... but no one answered , and the first thing that I imagine is that they come to the town , quickly I went out to find they ...
But there was no one , absolutely no one , I 'm scary , I yell and scream , look and look but I had no result
Suddenly I felt a warm hand that touched my shoulder and very slowly turn but the only thing I saw was a shadow that was holding a knife
I woke up and realised it had all been a bad dream
Recently when I was in youtube I saw a movie trailer , the film appeared so good and days later my friends told me if I wanted to go them to the cinema , so I decided to go and luckily they had decided to see the film that days before I had seen .
The film is a romantic movie , It is talking about one man , Noa , who lives in a small shore town when he felt in love with a rich girl , but like always the girl 's parents did not like Noa 's life because the girl 's father thinks that Noa is not enough good for their daughter .
And at the end of the summer the girl went out but next year she comes again , but this time she has boyfriend and this break Noa 's heart .
What Noa does not knows is that she was in love with him since the first time that she saw him .
The first of all I should say that I like a lot of kinds of sports .
One of my favourite types of sport is swimming .
I swim from childhood . I feel enjoy while I am swimming .
Swimming develop all types of muscles .
You can swim during all year in the swimming pool , sea , rivers and so on .
Advice for everyone who starts swim is feel enjoy while you swimming .
Thank you for your attention !
With the rising prices for the public transport in London , commuters are choosing using their cars more and more .
Public transport was create to release the traffic in big town centres and also to facilitate workers commute .
Nowadays trains and buses are usually packed and the ticket fares are very expensive .
I particularly decided to drive to do my day to day tasks such as , shopping , visiting friends , church and so on .
To whom may it concern :
I came upon your ad on the newspaper and I wish to apply for the job .
I 'm a great people person and have a great knowledge on computers , organising activities for children and also I 'm a Jr. chef .
I hope you can grant me the opportunity to have a meeting .
Sincerely yours .

Hi my name is Robert .
My favourite sport is basketball .
I really like this sport .
I was 7 years old when I played first time .
My first match was when I have been in school .
Our team won this match .
We were happy with this .
My advice for someone who want to play this game , you do n't have to be tall or fast , when you play you have to think a lot .
I enjoy this game because the most important thing is team work , you have to understand each other .
It 's really important to be tall because you will score point faster and better .
My favourite player is Marcin Gortat .
He is Polish basketball player .
He is really tall hi have 202 centimeters .
My story with basketball were very short .
I ca n't give you to many advice but one thing I know , a team work the most important thing in this game .
To begin , all is very difficult here .
First place , my country 's politics is bad , and people have not work .
In second place , there are very important people , and they want to have a lot of money .
Young people want to find a good job here , but they are working in mc donal 's or burguer king for a low salary .
If you want to work here , you must know languages , for example : English , French or German .
You must be a person in charge and worker , and you be able to find a good work .
My family have a company , and if you want , you going to work with them .
I wish as lot of luck you , here .
If you have problems , you can call me ! !
I wait for your call .
Television is an essential part in our life , we turn it on nearly everyday , since it can make life more interseting .
Television entertains us , it can also educate .
There are two pionts to approve it .
For one , the show played on television may enlight us and give us some enlightenment .
Teleplay are not just for fun , it can have a deep meaning , short story tells big deal , just like a useful book .
So , why not television can not educate us ?
For another , there are many different types of programs , which can broaden our eyes , they give details of education , plus other meaningful information , such as documentaries , talk show and so on .
These programs are not just for killing the time , but for educating .
Television is just like a kaleidoscope , there are various materials provided for us .
To sum up , television entertains , it ca also educate .
Syria has a lot of good restaurants .
The Damascus restaurant at the centre of the city is quite a nice place to have a meal .
It has all kinds of food even the really fancy ones .
You can enjoy having your breakfast there with your family because they have too many types of food .
This restaurant also has games for children which they can spend their time playing it .
It also includes a huge parking so you can park your own car freely .
At Friday they serve special food for those who do n't have enough money to pay .
It 's a very nice restaurant which I prefer the most
Invention of car has made people 's lives easier .
No more they have to solely depend on public transport .
Though public transport are cheaper and one could get to know many companions , increase network .
But public transport has fixed schedule and on a rushing day not many can really enjoy their journey .
Public transport ca n't help when one has to travel suddenly or to go somewhere where it does n't pass through .
Those times car is convenient to use .
Ever increasing crowd in cities and thereby traffic problems are increasing .
The home of the future .
In present times the houses is very different , but in the future houses will be
perhaps the same .
The future houses will be different not from architecture , but the functionality .
Different people will be needed different functions , options and functionality of the future house .
This will be like in ancient times , but in the past the houses was the same all round .
Progress of the technique is very fast .
From : horses , steam vehicle , first petrol and gas car to future cars when the drive will be electricty .
The last film I saw was " The Enormous Island " so I am going to review it for the students film club .

Often I like to read biography books , history books and novels , but I really like Jane Austen books .

I have at home lots of books here and in my country but I like to go to the library and sometimes I go and have a look on charithy and bootsale because I can find lots of nice books and a very good price for them .
When I need a book for my English classes I go to Waterstone or to Amazon .
Few mounts ago I read Miserable by Victor Hugo , I read this book when I was in high school but I haven't think on the subject .

This Saturday I start a new book by Francine River , the book could The Warior I haven't finish the first chapter but I find the book very good .
I read others books by this writer and I really enjoyed .
The public transport in the near future
Nowadays there are many ways to public transportation such as underground , buses , and etc . but is a reality that the people prefer to move by car .
Currently traveling by car is useful than public that transport , you can move around the city and reduce enough time sometimes you can share your car with friends or family and this way of transportation will be cheaper .
Teacher , I know to travel by car is the most convenient .
However , I think your mind is similar to what forebear thought , because for them , society are never going to get the transport we have nowadays .
It is difficult for us to imagine a world in which there are not cars like we are used to see .
Nevertheless , I trust in that technologies can suffer a progress in the future .
Moreover , we have still a lot of things which we can and must improve like travelling security , comfort and economic sources .
On the other hand , we should know that every means of transportation can be changed by 50 years later .
Maybe , we could find with flying cars or electric bikes .
For all that , I think that we should be prudent when we assess means of transportation .
According to Wordsworth a poet is not a common man , he has a greater sensibility and knowledge .
The power of imagination makes him become a teacher : he has to show men how to understand their feelings and the nature that surround them .
The poet is seen as a prophet , he has to improve people 's moral life and drive them to the truth .
He is the only one who can produce poetry in a simple language , thanks to imagination and memory .
I live in a big city and I have the opportunity to see a lot of tourists during the year .
Sometimes I give some information about where the name of streets or where the main monuments are .
I have any particular problem to help them , but I have often some doubt to suggest the place to go for a shopping .
The reason is that in my city there are a lot of shopping facilities good for tourists .
An example could be to have a free entrance in the Campidoglio museum if you buy a local newspaper .
Also , there are some well - known brand ready to give a special prize if you but a souvenir after 8 pm .
As you see there are a lot of opportunities for the tourists to spend their own money in my city .
You have only choose what is the best for you .
You will not regret .

My town do much efforts to care of environment , they put many pins in the streets to keep it clean also they prevent private drivinig at many days to keep air clean , they seed trees to absorb co2 and release o2 , they build factories away from the house of population to prevent respiratory diseases which is a result of air pollution from factories , so not only my country it self but also the individuals follow a proper way to keep environment clean .
Football is my favourite sport and I enjoy it because it is an aggressive game and fun .
The game starts with a ball at the centre of the field and them one of the two teams kicks it .
The goal is to get the ball inside the opponents net with your foot only .
In 1994 , The Scream painting , one of the most expensive of the worls , was stolen in the National Gallery of Oslo ( Norway ) .
At first the police detective thought one of the special band was stolen the painting .
Then , researchers knew that Pal Enger , art - thief more popular in Norway , was who stolen the painting .
Only he needed 50 second to stolen the painting .
When he stolen the painting he wrote a note sayng : " thank you for your good security " and when he was arrested he declare that it was very easy to stolen the painting .
3 months ago , he wants 1 million dollars for the painting but the Norway government said no .
Finally , the Norway police catch the painting again in one policy investigation .
I have developed organizational and time management skills through my work with different companies .
Particularly , I am highly skilled in welcoming and directing customers .
About my personality , I am outgoing and enthusiastic .

wasting time is a huge issue in our life . a lot of knowledges related to time such as : history , education and healthy .
We discuss special topic about how we come faster than a time.this famous quote explains my previous idea " time is a sword if you did not cut it , it will cut you " .
Many people do n't care about wasting their time even when they busy .
Actually , in my life I consider it as a king of my system who controls whole of my day .
there is some people treat time As something of my own , they have the right to wast it and the right to look after it .
In the oposit side , some people let the time control their life .
However we should be balance from the both types .
she wasted it she can not get it back .
There is a time to love and a time to hate .
Also , there is a time to break down and a time to build up .
Imagine how you will live if you do n't have knowledge called ' time ' .
I will tell you my negative attitude about time before I take a lesson from my brother .
I did not care to time I usually said this is my life and my time .
But this is change after my brother arranges with me to organize our time .
He will leave me at home or pay for him two riyals for every minute if I late to him .
When I ask him to get me someplace . I can not count how many times I stay at home because I am late .
On time , penictual
I think that there is future for public transport , because there are still exist people who can not afford to buy a car , even travelling by car is much more convenient .
We have to consider people need to earn sufficient money to support their families and be able to buy a car .
I 'm Sara and i 'm 24 years old .
I 'm interested in this job because at the moment I haven't got a job .
I 'm a worker person and I like children .
In the work I 'm a responsibility person , I never last arriving .
Also I always work with children and I have a teacher certificate . I'm a friendlier person and I have a good curriculum .
My experience of this job y longer .
I began to work 4 years ago in a special children school .
This job is great because also I learn a lot of things .
i like to have sports activities and education activities .
my prefers activities are outin the freeair .
I like prepare my activities a week before , then when I have to do this activity it is more fast .
I think that this job is for the children enjoy so I 'm the correct person because I like playing with them .
In the terms of making bank notes , the picture below demonstrate the process of making it .
There are mainly 4 stepts , design , preparation , printing and inspecting .
This writing will explain these different stept .
Firstly , staff and Personnel design the background colour , the artwork and the scuriity issues on the bank notes , which is also done in process of other card , such as notes for supermarket .
Then in the preparation process , skilled machinists prepare of metal plates for printing .
After that sheets of bank notes are printed , there are differences and specials for it , it use special ink , and print colors on both side , images are slightly rised .
At last inspectors of the bank manually check all printing sheets , and devid them into three levels."bad sheets " were sent for disposal , where things are sercurely destroyed."Good quality sheets " will go with packaging and distribution , where sheets are cut , packed and dispatched .
However sheets that are " partally damages " will be inspect again and separated into good and bad sheets , and sent for further actions .
I 'd like to wtite in this subject because it 's very importnant topic .
my favourite sport is football , I like it so much it means for me a lot , It means partnership , teamwork , entertainment , exercise .
the whole world get together to support there favourite teams & the boys played it in the streets together .
I enjoyed it when I watch it on TV or when I attend it in the stade & supporte my team by my flag & supported phrases .
I advise any one dream to be one of the most famous teams that works on hisself a lot & and play football a lot to be profectional in this sport & show a lot of matches & followed by captain supervised on him
This issue is not clear - cut on both money and job satisfaction are important in deciding career in our life .
I think that on balance it is more important to try to get satisfaction .
First , happiness comes from inside our mind .
We work eight hours a day so if we submerge in a bloody pond in a long time could definitely turn ourselves frustrated .
I would choose a job with satisfaction .
In my own case , I am working as a co - cook in a diner .
Cooking has been my favorite in my life .
Costumers ' satisfaction brings me happiness .
Although the heat in the kitchen could burn us , the smile on the customers gives the best courage .
Also , the satisfaction from the customers pushes me to work harder and be better on my job .
Job satisfaction could make us to purchase perfection .
The more I can perform the much I can gain .
As a result , job satisfaction is a good way to get better paid .
I believe I could someday become a chef in my own restaurant and serve my customer a fabulous dish .
On the whole , therefore , I feel that it is best to go for a career that we will enjoy if this is possible .

The Home of the Future .
At the moment we have a nice house with the garden .
But what will be in the future ?
Possible we will in a space or underground .
In the future everything can change .
It can be painted with new colour .
It can be with the flowers .
But I think that not many change .
Probably houses will be smaller or bigger .
They do not look like big white ball .
Variety of negative impacts appears under rapid urbanization .
Urban flood is one of them .
Not only the growing impervious surfaces , but also the " false " green infrastructure contributes to it .
Mountains of studies demonstrated that green infrastructure is an economical , beautiful and effective strategy to control storm water .
However , urban flood keeps raging even when the amount of green infrastructure full fills the storm water control needs in some areas .
What is the obstacle that stopped these green infrastructures from providing the ecosystem service of mitigating and eliminating urban flood ?

Our Mistakes mistake made us better than before if in life we had't got any mistake we would n't succeed that 's why the mistakes are very important in life and I believe our mistake improve us so
but in another way there just one mistake and you could not come back or arranged your mistake
This article is about how I think about the efficiency of public transport .
As I lived more than 12 years on the countryside I was dependent on busses and trains .
In the morning , I needed to get to school and in the evenings public transport helped me to get home .
I hold the opinion that a more frequent and more regular transport is needed .
Spontaneous activities were impossible as you always had to plan to advance .
I was hardly waiting for my 18th birthday .
I do agree television advertising direct toward young children should not bet allowed for several reasons .
First , this kind of advertisement should be forbiden reasoning the fact young children are still strongly vulnerable .
Kids around these age ( 2 to 5 years old ) do not have a maturated critical sense and anything can easyly persuade them .
For instance , when I was three years old I used to be captivated for all the toys which were presented on tv commercials just because the way they were exposed .
One of them was " the ultimate max steel " which was about a hundred dollars .
Secondly , I am also opposed the allowance of this advertisement because the severely consequence it causes into the parents and child 's relationships .
It is common we see parents having issues with their kids in reason to this kind of commercial .
Many parents have an unhealthy relationship , or even a wrecked relationship , with their kids .
One example is what happened with / to my cousin Patricia when she had her first child called Sophia .
One day sophia got really excited with an advertisement about barbie doll and she could not think about anything else than having this toy .
Unfortunately , my cousin did not have enough money to buy it , but her daughter - a three years old kid- did not understand it and got angry with Patricia , do not speaking well with her for three weeks !
In conclusion , I am strongly favourable to this statement . Advertisement for young kids , not only until 5 but until 8 years old should be forbiden reasoning the kid 's vulnerability and the risk to their parents ' relationships with them .
In last case , if the advertisements were still exposed , It would be essential some educational politics come with them , valorizing and teaching kids on understanding their parents .
Dear Mrs Kate Ashby ,
I read your advertisement in my newspaper last week .
You have asked about a server in your cafe .
I think , it 's a great job for me .
I 'm very talented to work with people .
In my education at school , i learned to cook and to wait a table .
Also I can work long hours .
In another job before , I worked per day for 8 ours .
So I think , it 's no problem for me , to stay and run the whole day .
I made one week a internship in a restaurant in my village .
There I saw , how a venture like this work and you must not to show me the whole work again .
I 'm really interested in that job .
By the way I live near to the cafe , so I have a short duty stroke and come every time punctual .
Yours sincerely
Niklas Lakatos

If you are looking for a movie to see , I recommend you " Nemo " , it 's the most beautiful Disney 's movie .
The story is about a couple of clownfish who are attacked by a shark , only the dad and one baby egg survived .
The baby name was nemo .
When Nemo grows up , he goes to his first school day , there he is going to be captured by a man .
The only thing they found was a pair of googles that said the direccion of the man .
Nemo 's father knowns a fish called Doris that wanted to helped him , they cross all the ocean to go to Nemo 's location to save him , while Nemo tries to survive in a dentist house .
They finally meet and get happy again with a lot of good friends .
I think you would love it .
With love , Santiago .
This question is awkward for me because I do not like sport .
When I was young I tried Badminton , Squash and Teakwondo .
I do n't do sport now ,
I try to keep fit , and I walk one hour every day .
It is a fact that pollution is the one of the biggest concernment of advanced world .
The reason can be attributed to increased consumeristic nature and unware about waste management .
In the following paragraphs , am going to analyze these issuses in a detailed way to provide solution .
Dear Tom
I 've fully understand why is so difficult finding which activity is more important for You .
I think I would have the same perpelxity .
However sometimes we need to sacrifice something when we do n't have enough time for everything .
As you know I am a person who likes sport and music , but if I have to decide which of those activity are more important then I would prefer sport .
I think the physical activity can give us more profit in our life .
For example if You are active every day , you can keep your health in good condition .
Sport activity also make us feel more flexible and ready to force every day .
In conclusion I think you should give up your music classes .
Regards
Mikolaj
Truly , there is no future for public transport .
Nowadays cars are more affordable than ever .
Almost every single household has more than one car .
With the development of the technologies , people will use other means of transport .
Having in mind that the society is also changing , people will tend to choose their place of work , which is near their home and wo n't need to spend time travelling .
We are witnessing a great development of the work from home these days , which will also lead to fewer people using public transport .
Three Suggestions to be Doctor
Do want to be doctor?.Many people around the world want to help people , so they choose to study medical .
If you want to be a doctor , you should do this three things .
First , you have to study hard every single day at the high school .
When study hard at the high school you will be
By looking at current situation of people 's lives , we can imagine the changes that can occur in future .
People are not interested in physical exercise & healthy food instead they are very much interested in earning money .
With no physical exercise & Healthy food people are damaging their health and family relations .
Now a days nobody has enough time to spend with family , Rather they prefer to make more money by working extra hours
If people live the same way as now , in future people will be considered as working robots instead of human beings .
When I was a junior high school student , I enjoyed playing basketball with my classmates .
For some reasons , I really liked to play basketball , first , playing basketball can train my muscle and make the body more healthier ; the second , my classmates and I all know how to win a game through the basketball game because the basketball game is a teamwork .
If you play the basketball and enjoy the game , you just go to the basketball gym with a basketball , trying to throw the ball into the basket again and again .
Do n't forget to play with your friends .
Three paradigms result from the attempt to characterizing epistemologically Spanish tourism research through the study of the AECIT Conference proceedings .
They are distinguished mainly by the disciplines from which they come : marketing and management , economics and geography .
Not everyone has car , so public transport is needed for every country .
Public transport is helping people to get work on time and help to reduce pollution .
Also , for low income families , they could n't afford to buy new cars , then transposition will help them to survive .
Public transport is also reduce the daily traffic .
it helps people to keep track their schedule .

Hi Michael ,
How are you ? I just want to say hello .
Currently , I stand at Syntagma square in Athens and it 's tremendously hot weather ! The sun is literally burning ! I 'm going to have a meeting with other international volunteers here in an hour .
I am looking forward to it as a small kid ! :)
I had the pleasure to visit Hotel Sparta at Omonia square on my first day in Greece .
I spent last night in this hotel .
I watched a Greek TV show .

We can really confirm that there is no future for public transport , if so , we will have to drive a car instead of buying a ticket for public transport and go to office , city , home and so on using private transport , however we can also think that in the centre has no parking car or it is not enough for the whole private car , thereby , if we use a public transport , we can simplify our lives and spend less simply because we are able to save money and time .
A comparison between people who like to use a public transport and private transport shows that first one can save money and time but also they are in relax much more than people who use private transport .
Finally , I do n't think that private transport is much better than public transport .
I hope that those people who wrote this article can change their thought and can likely to write a very useful article .
i like volei because it was part of my life and of life of my mother , is my favorite sport , but i like over sports too , same i do n't play volei because I 'm bad , and my friends that know , do n't like of peoples bad of volei .
I'm watching they playing , they 're really very good , but when play over school , they 're very bad
In modern growing world , The basic needs of general public are increasing day by day and their expectations on quality of life took a new dimensions .
When we were in our childhood , we used to deal with public transport for going one place to another because that was only a cheaper option available .
But today , Things are getting change and technology marked a significant role in our life , Automobile segment increased its vertical and having a car becomes a need from luxory .
We can see nowadays , more and more people would prefer to use their own car instead of buses or taxis because they feel comfortable and mobile in it .
A car can help him to go anywhere and anytime in much less time as compared to public transport .
I believe , as soon as Automobile sector develop new technology in cars people will more keen to use their own vehicle instead or public transport .
There are many reasons responsible for a better understanding between parents and child .
The first reason is no other than generation gap .
What is more , parents always consider their child best .
Parents often compare child to others also plays a role in this case .
As far as I know how to better understanding between parent and child .
According to the present situation it is a pity that their relative influence happiness family .
Therefore it is an important that we should cerebrate this problem .
The sum up the above argument , we should take some measures and have positive attitude .
On the one hand , we may take a communication forum , it can share everyone 's cerebration .
On the other hand , we should stand in other point and think their reasons .
Only by talking your points with your parents can prove all the problem .
Furthermore talking with parents can provide argued with them .
All in all , if you were to do this , your parents will not blame for you .
the wellness depend on three important factors : sport , nutrition and sleep .
the factor that we talk about is sport .
the sport is very important for the health .
the sport increase our physical performance .
the are a lot type of sports but one of them is the most practice in the world : the football .
football is a simple sport , where the player must kick the ball in the opponent goal . in this sport , you improve principally the leg muscles but all your body move .
homever the football is so competitive .
all the states in the world have an own league .
the best three team in the national league can take part at champions league ( in Europe ) or Asian league ( in Asia ) and so on .
lately a lot of child wish to be a professional player and they practice this sport every time and everywhere to improve the techinique .
homewer a lot of him ca n't reach this scope for a lot of reasons : no money , the height ( all team require a tall player ) and so on .
the football is very funny and you can play it everywhere with someone .
the football is a sport that group and fun a lot of nation .
For us ( Mainque and Lucia ) computers does n't have to replace the humans . because they do n't have brain and ca n't feel anything .
Computers do things that humans could n't , or it 's very difficult or it take so much time .
Computers have to obey orders of humans .
Computers depend on humans for their existence .
And it is going to be for all the eternity .
Humans is the best ! ! ! !
The graph is taken from the website " Statistiken aus Deutschland " .
It depicts the growth of the population in " Germany " .
The diagramm shows the development of 1998 to 2014 .
The graph comprises only German people and no migrants .
You can see it rose sharply in 2003 .
In 2005 was a low but it grew than again .
1998 you are able to see that it decreased slightly .
" The Exorcist " , the film .
" The Exorcist " , is one of the most exciting and astonishing thriller that I have seen in my life .
Actor 's interpretativos are sublime , and they make you feel afraid all film .
Especial effects are amazing .
Even though is destacable the fidelity with the text of the novel .
On thing that I find interesting , is that this film is atemporal ; I mean that you can watch in any decade of your life , and ever seems a nowadays film .
This confirm " The Exorcist " is a great film .
Nowadays , with the development of society , a large number of forests and lands are replaced by blocks and transport networks .
This will cause three problems to we humans and animals .
First and foremost , it can make contaminations to the environment , which can affect our health
Through this comparison the author wants to mark that the pagan spring festival may look like celebration of christian beliefs , but it is not .
On Easter time the important thing is to consecrate Christian tradition on the contrary , the pagan spring festival does n't focous on consecration but rather on celebration
My town takes care of the environment because the people of my town try to plant how many trees and plants they can .
The people of my town try to plant plants in the centre or somewhere is too smoke , so they try to keep the air at recommended levels.on the morning a lot of people go on footto the work or to the school or ride a bike or they take the bus .
The people try to move the local factories out of country where is less air polluted , less smoke , less cars and more forests and plants .
travelling by is convenient but for mass poeple public transport is very important and much need .
no of all people could afford to make conveyenc by car .car is easy and cozy also but public transprt is fair is much affordable to all clasess of poeple
public transport means mainly pubic bus.people used to travell long disistance by publis bus .it is possible to carry large number of people of different places to carry in bus .

Why does culture differences sometimes cause a division of a country ?
Recently Scotland really has ' Hit the world ' for some of the Scotch have tried their best for the Scotland referendum .
Although I knew that there is some conflication between England and Scotland , but the vote has really shocked me .
However , just as I thought , more than 50 percent Scots voted ' no ! ' , so Scotland did n't separated from the United Kingdom .
Public transport is here to stay .
- This goes without saying cars are much more convenient than late trains , but I can not agree with the overall statement although I do abhor using public transport .
I have been travelling with both for yeras , and I reckon each and everyone ends up needing public transport one day or another .
I would be a tad oblivious thinking vehicle ownership is granted beforehand when younger .
As a grown - up now , I know full well how more affordable public transport is albeit less than before .

The rapid advancing information technology and the development of Internet networks enable the evolution of banking activities at a comprehensive level .
The connectivity derived from Internet provides the invaluable business tool for online banking .
It influenced the consumers behavior on banking services .
The consumers from traditional branch banking moving towards using electronic delivery channels like personal computer ( PC ) and mobile phones is the most fundamental changes .

Compared with the past when we use horse for transportation .
Did the people have the same opinion that there is no future for transport , and we only can use horse ?
The reason for why we have such improvement is that the technology and innovation have changed our life .
Cars replaced the horse , and even plane have replaced the cars for long distance transportation .
So I think there will be future for public transportation , and this may because of the updated technologies .
My favourite sport is a football soccer because it is the most popular on the worl .
After school my friends and I go to a park to play soccer , we play for two hours .
when they were in the hospital because Fernanda foodbone , they gave her some chicken soup with a ladle , so she could drinker easily , she started feeling much better so they decided her mom and Daniela to leave Fernanda on their house so she could get some rest and so she could ate more chicken soup , because they want Fernanda to feel better .
Daniela 's mom and her returned to the park , to continued piking the trash from the grass .
Later they went to see a grotesque stroke , after Fernanda crying called Daniela 's mom because she also felt bad with the chicken soup , and she wanted to know in how much time they 'll returned to their house .
So Daniela 's mom and Daniela arrived at home at 11:00pm it was obscure and they would n't me able to see Fernanda , on that time the light turned off , and they try to put them on but the lights did n't turn on .
They slept , at the next morning they light turned on , and they saw Fernanda standing in front of them very tired of waiting them , so she get angry with them and went to her room and she did n't come out from her room .
Her mom tried to tell Fernanda that they arrived very late because they had a very perplexed problem , so her mom told her that they came out from the park at 9:00pm it was still late but not too late , so they were on the street and the police arrived because they police thought that she had a globe with wine , and her mother told the police that she does n't have alcohol or wine on her car , and they police did n't believed her and they took them to the police station so they could check his car , and about 10 minutes approximately they told her that she did n't have nothing so they , went from there to their house and it was late , so that 's the reason .
She had allude the police before that she did n't have anything on the car .
When Fernanda came out from her room , she started prying on her mom wallet if she did n't have anything about the police or something and she did n't have anything so she forgave her .
But Fernanda summoned up the courage to ask her if she was n't telling any lies to her , and her mom told her that she vow that is n't any lie .

If I told you that , Travelling with a car or by bus , which one you will pick .
a lot of people nowadays will take their own car , it 's easier and flexible .
But why public transport have no future to stand and keep going ? , that 's because of the people that changing their mind , they start like having their own way to travel , Privacy also an important reason , people need to have a private means of transportation .
that 's why there is no future for public transport
I promised to lean for math the whole week .

I do n't want to study but there is no way out .
I have to .
My favourite sport is football , the principal reason why I like it is because when I was younger , I played with my friends and we got together to play every day .
I remember those years and I would like that my children will practise it when they will be oldest , an interesting sport .
My favourite team in Spain is Real Madrid , the best team .
If I were football player , I would like played in this team , but I think that it is very difficult because , only the best players gets it .
Nowadays I like others sports to practise : tennis , Basketball , ... but I prefer playing football with my mates on weekends , and then we drink some beers in the pub to celebrate the victory or the defeat .
These moments are very special and I hope to be able to enjoy for many years .
Finally I recommend this sport for the child in order to get a healthy life , get together with their friends and forget for much time alcohol and drugs .
I love sports and I believe to practise it is the best to get a good life .
I am here to write about a composition about public transportation in Somalia specially the capital city Mogadishu where there is a little public transport comparing to our neighboring countries . there is a scarcity of public transport and there is one type and model which Van as well as very distracted roads which may cause collateral damage .
Sometimes passengers and drivers face risks and road blocks which usually happen when the Somali government leaders are travelling across the city and even abroad .
So having good infrastructure helps a lot and constant peace and the people of Somalia will not suffer any more .
Thanks .
Hello friends , you 're welcome to Puerto , here we have a lot of shops .
What would you like to buy ?
We have a commercial center very nice .
If you want you can buy a lot of things there .
1 . Is it possible to go without compression machine ?
Will we can to compress ducts manually ?
2 . I 've noticed that the machine cost is higher than it 's been anteriorly .
Please , send to us actual strip material price .
3 .
If we want to produce spiro ducts and other articles in future .
Do we have to buy one new special machine ?
As for as public Transport you can save fuel as well as pollution but it take more time to reach the destination .
while if you have your own conveyance you can save time and moreover it is safe .
the most important thing is there would be huge traffic on the roads and traffic movement will be very slow .
but keeping in view of environment we should prefer to use public transport

I live in Bhubaneswar with my family .
About fifty thousand people live in the city .
It is clean and environmentally friendly city .
The city has its own public transportation system , waste management system .
People live here take care of city environment , so the city became clean and green place .
The city contain about thirty public parks .
The parks are full of greenery ; these parks also used as playground for children .
Trees in the parts are not sufficient as per requirement of our city .
Ten year before , local governing body of the city decide to plant more tree and it asked advice from the citizens of the city about the proposal .
Everybody got interested in the project .
We planted trees near side of highway , unused lands , and outside of the city .
Now these trees are grownup .
It give shades , shelter to animals , and purify air .
The trees are also stop soil erosion in rainy season .
Our city have a well equipped waste management system .
Each house in the city have two verity of dustbin to keep recyclable and non - recyclable items separately .
In Morning , waste collection truck came and it take these waste .
These waste materials are processed with environmentally friendly .
The last film I saw was not new , in fact it was " The Others "
The others is a film that is based on a family that lives in a house and in this where many strangers things happen .
The principal character is Grace that is the mother of her two children Nicholas and Anne .
The hudsband of Grace is called Charles .
In the film there were servants , they were Bertha Mills , Mr Tuttle and Lydia .
This film is about a family that lives in a very big house .
Charles has to go to the war and Grace and her sons stayed in that house but not they were not alone they were with Bertha Mills , Mr Tuttle and Lydia .
The problem is that the mother started to listen many wear sounds and her sons were not doing them , so who was the responsible .
Her sons have a problem they ca nt see the natural light and one they Grace got up because her children were shouting and crying so she went to their bedroom and the courtins was not there so she go to the other room and the courtins also were not there so she stars getting nervous and more nervous so she go and talk to the servants , so she got very angry and she told them go out of my house and they did not care so she pick up a gun and the old lady returned her keys .
Then many things happened , and then they discover that the ghost were not the servants .
Of course I recommend this movie , because it is very interesting and in some parts is funny too , and Nicole is the principal character so I love it !
In my opinion I do not agree with what journalists do , or to me if I were a movie star , a famous man who has done many performances I do not like every hour of the day to be pursued by journalists .
In addition , everyone wants to have a moment of privacy and because journalists papparazzi can not have a moment to relax , tutoring for children or dependent on what else you want to do it and you can not because journalists .
And another reason why I have so right in what I had to say in the ranks above you feel if you were in game then people are always these people and destroy families because they declare false Intrigue sometimes .
Sometimes abuse the right to be a journalist with all sorts of questions with no response or have a partial response to these famous people can say that journalists have a stressful job for some people .
And finally I would like to say yes are against these people , or still might change their style and everything would be ok !

Aactivist of animals rights claimed that the reason is the keeping animals in zoo .
But lot of peoples saying that , the zoo can protected endagered spices against illegal poachers .
So what should we do with that problem ?
To sum up , there are lot of cleary strong arguments for against keeping animals in zoo .
In my opinion people should bulid some kind of wildlife parks . This solution will allow
people to watch animals in their natural environment , and most importantly , will allow
animals to safely reproduce .
It 's really expensive sollution , but we must do that for
our next generations .

My town is called Assuit . the People here , have no knowledge about how to use their rubbish.people throw their rubbish everywhere . on the other hand , we haven't any kind of law , that can limit that action ; I mean rubbish throwing .
So if we still doing nothing new , out country will still unattractive .
Humans prefer luxurious life .
Public transport is a bit uncomfortable .
With the coming of cars , people are using public transport rarely .
Everyone prefer to have his / her own car.so the future of public transport is very dark .
This is an alarming issue that needs to be addressed at earliest .
Because if everyone uses his / her car pollution will increase and that will eventually affect every living being .

Young people may like to take a walk in king garden , there is sakura trees .

Why I enjoy my favouite sport ?
So I think my favorite sport is go walking through the nature .
I love it , when the temperatur is a little bit cold , but not too much .
I can relaxing , when i walk alone and hear the noise of the birds in the trees .
I live in a little village near a forest , so I can go everyday walking through it .
There are so much animals and when you are quite , you can see a deer or a fox .
And sometimes I take my camera with me , because I love photography and there are so much great motifs .
Rest ... aurant .
There 's nothing like eating !
We all agree on that , eating food is one of the best moments on our day , it 's like word stops for a few minutes in which you are just enjoying your food .
But there 's a differenc between eating a good meal , and eating by the way .
In this opportunity i 'm going to talk about different cool restaurants we could choose at the moment of going out as the close of classes .
Michael decided to open the door and back for her , he thought better the things he do not want to leave her again , he like her , he knows himself and he wants to know her , he have kept all his feelings for a long time .
Which was the reason ?
The reason is the next , three days ago , he was working when a girl of his job asked him whether he had girlfriend and he told , I had one , come on you know my ex - girlfriend then she only walked without tell nothing .
it was strange for Michael .
He remembered , two years ago when he had been working and he decided to back home early while he had been backing to home he saw his girlfriend with other guy they were hugging .
he arrived the home and he only thought and thought all night it was the second time that she has been unfaithful since then he is alone .
Today in the morning he have not gone to work and he was staying in a pub to drink beer , then a girl went to him , he knew her , she is Abigail .
This girl is an acquantance him .
They were talking about their lives and he remembered like he knew her on the bus , maybe she have always been the woman of his live he looked at eyes and smile he wants to ask her whether now is not late to satart to know her but he decided leave the pub he walked to exit .
Finally Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake .
I had a terrible experience in this Chinese New Year!Because Norovirus infected me!At first , I had a high fever but I thought if I take some medicine I will be fine .
Therefore , my condition took a sharp turn for the worse .
I can not eat anything even in New Year 's Eve and I was so tired that I can not play poker with my cousins .
Though everythings were depressing , I still have a wonderful winner vacation with my family : we went to Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village(九族)to visited its blooming cherry blossom.(I do n't know its variety~Is it from Japan??XD)Cherry blossom is very beautiful but there are so many people .
When we went to Sun Moon Lake by cable car , wind is so strong!I felt a little nervous though the scenery amazing .
All in all , I stil have a memorable vacation .
Hi Luke ,
I tried that new programme in the internet for English learners called Write and Improve from Cambridge English .
I liked the way the page tells you your progress and marks your mistakes so you could fix them .
I hope to see you soon .

My living room is the best room in my house because it is big , comfortable and beautiful .
There are some images for my family on the wall .
There is a coffee table made of wood with a clear glass .
Also on the sofas there are many colorful Pillows
There is a bookcase next to the rocking chair and when I have a free time I sitting on it and reading a book .
There are three sofas around a coffee table and it is so comfortable .
When I want studying for exams going to the living room and sitting front of TV
In addition , there is a small blackboard for my littel brother because my mother wants my prother learn Arabic and English letters .
There is a small gray carpet under the coffee table and it protects the things from breakage .
For this reason I spend most of my time there
On the other hand , the economic situation plays an important role .
It is very common that the bad economy of some countries force their people to emigrate to another country .
When this phenomenon occur most of the migrants need to learn the new language to adapt to the new environment .
As a consequence , they forgot their first language .
Another important point is the necessity of approval by some some indigenous groups or people that emigrate from the countryside to the city in order to get a better lifestyle .
It is not a surprise that this situation is something more frequent every day .
We are facing a crucial moment due to the extinction of most of the indigenous languages .
Public transport will be worse in the future than travelling by car because it is uncomfortable and slowly .
In Spain many people will travel in their car or by car with their colleague or friends , this transport is quick , but it is much more expensive .
If you travel with other people it is the same expens than public transport .
In my opinion sharing a car we will arrive at work on time and when we will finish work we can go directly home .
I think public transport is n't the future because many people today live outside the big cities in the suburbs .
The apartments in the cities are much more expensive and the people prefer to travel in their car .
I think there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
But it 's better to travel by car pooling .
People who needs to go in the same direction , meet each other and use only one car .
This is convenient for the cost of travelling , because every cost is divided for the participants and is an experience to meet other people .
Hi Jo ,
My country very interesting place , we have more ancient and mistyc places .

First of all , thank you professor to teach in the meantime , the entire course of the learn really benefited , especially in the first meeting , for British English , I still did not really understand , it makes me frustrated , but gradually after I found the beautiful of the language in British English , I think it 's all because of the usual problem of American English , and so I really appreciate that you choose simple textbooks and it 's easy to learn , and you really very carefully and very humorous , you 're always careful in curriculum pronunciation correction for each student , using a variety of reading skills let us immerse them read .
I love to listen to British English , but it 's really hard to study , all because we are all learning American English in Taiwan , so when I have the opportunity to contact British English , it 's full of tone cadence , always feel particularly charming , and British culture exudes noble temperament , so British accent sounds like there is always an indescribable elegance qualities .
And the strengths and weaknesses in both of segmental and suprasegmental , I think it 's maybe the learning habit , when I heard a sentences , I would use many varieties of tone and manner to say the sentences again , therefore , I can easily be interpreted illustrations instructions the emotions and feelings .
Only possible in segmental pronunciation , the occasional missed a few notes , such as -d , I did not noticed this because when I deliberately stressed -d , I found the tone and mood more likely to become very weird , this is the biggest problem I 've encountered in pronunciation teaching .
I 'm not teaching English in my new school , but in the future if there is the chance I will definitely give it a try , especially in the curriculum learned some teaching tips , the biggest gain this course is to read picture books to read and record , because that and English proficiency is not just training , but will note that strengthen their pronunciation and intonation , and then each time peer feedback also completed the listening exercises .
If I have an opportunity to back on English teaching , I think I will try this skill to get my students to do the recordings heard training , then make their English better and better .
My village is in the north of the region of the Extremadura .
The population of my village is about sixteen hundred people .
It is situated on the inland .
The first stop for most visitors is the church because the neighbors clean and cared .
The town hall put in the streets containers for trash and the workers of tomw hall clean the streets .
Besides this , everybody cleans their doors to keep it tidies up .
What 's more , all people once a year , plant trees in all village for it is more beautiful .
To begin with , nowadays more and more people prefer trevelling by car rather than by bus or train .
Certainly , it is more comfortable to travel by your own transport with your family or your friends . You can stop and have a rest wherever you want .
You can change your plans and choose another direction .
For differentiate between old computers and computers today , would first have to describe each type of machine .
I start describing old computers which we saw in the video were few simple machines ( at the time they were created ) and covering an enormous room .
On top of that these machines only worked when it is wrote an order to the computer .
These were experiential models .
Visually colors ranging on the screen were the black and green .
Currently in the 21st century , computers have had a very long technology advance which range from the software and the size internal memory ( bigger than the old computers ) , the size of the computer ( which is varied but more smaller than the previously computers ) and its shape , the weight of it ( they are more lightweight ) and variations in the colors of the screen ( visually ) .
Finalize can tell that with the passage of time people we change the way we see the world , comes into play evolution , not only of technology but also of society , religion , etc .
essential in the life of people , but sow will be factors that humans will not be able to modify and it is better to continue as they are .
Sometimes famous people want to be alone without any journalist .
In my opinion , staying alone means that you have something to think about , for example to think about our deeds .
Journalists follow you and they do n't give you to live such as normal pupil .
To tell you the truth , I like being alone very often .
To be on my own and watch the other people live .
I always wear a mask , I can be myself only with my close people .
In the end , I want to tell you that we are not robots , everyone deservs that they want .
My opinion it 's opposite of them of this composition .
I did n't have a car .
Every day I used to taking public transport .
I live in a city , and for many people live like me , the most convenient transport is the public transport .
With a car in the city , we have some problems .
there is a heavy traffic , and the difficulty in finding a parking place .
Every day , the population spends a lot of time in the traffic congestion .
It 's a very good method to travel in the city .
A car problem is the expensive price of the fuel .
I like public transport and I love my planet . I think the best method for reduce the polucion .
It 's used to public transport .
but it 's only my personal opinion .

An Unforgettable Lesson
There are various kinds of different things that happened in peoele 's life , some may be normal and nothings special , while others may be meaningful and unforgettable that you will remerber it for a long time .
Have you ever have this experience ?
When I am in elementary school , I joined a speaking contest , but I failed , and I had broken - hearted .
Becase I seldom practiced it .
But soon I made up my mind , thinking that I ca n't be so decadent forever I want some change , hoping I will be better in the next year .
So I practiced it day and night .
No matter it is sun or rain , wind or warm . And also asked teacher for help .
Eventually , I got number three in the comtest .
Through this time , I learn that win and lose is not the most significant thing .
The most important is that you can learn a valueabe lesson from failure .
Practice can make perfect .
And never give up .
Resolve/ dertermine / insistence
My country witnessed a tremendous change in the last ten years .
10 years ago , I was a child , and I can seldom eat meat in dinner .
But now , I feel uncomfortable without food everyday .
People 's health
Nowadays young people 's health is n't as healthy as for example twenty years ago .
One reason for the change may be due to the style of life that people have .
Currently we do usually less exercise than before because we use our car to go anywhere .
Whereas our style of food has changed very much .
We do n't eat at home and it 's very common eating junk food every week .
On the other hand , children are used to eat only what they want because in general they do n't like legumes , vegetables , fruits , fish ...
They like eating junk food , hamburgers , French fries and sweets and what 's more they do n't do any exercise .
All these reasons could be very bad for their health in the future .
So it 's very important to give them a healthy education .
To sum up , it is very important to be conscious about how food affect our health .
That 's the reason for we have to do more exercise , eat less fat and more vegetables and teach our children to eat better and healthier than they are used to do .
My opinion ofselfemployment
I never ever wanted to be selfemployed .
My dad and my grandfather had run their own business for more than 20 years .
My mother always told me that my dad had never time for her and my siblings .
When I was born my dad decided to quit his company to get more time for his family .
Nowadays , the car owners have been increasing in many countries , especially in developed countries , due to the convenience of travelling by car .
Thus , some people claim that the social trend tends to decline the popularity of travelling by public transport .
As a result , this development is highly controversial in positive and negative ways .
Today personal vehicle become pride of the life , mean if a person is on there personal vehicle they are look as higher status in the society .
so it become a fashion of using personal vehicle which create a lot of problem big one traffic problem .....
now traffic problem is the biggest problem . only solution to this use of public transport system as much as possible .
but now using public transport is looked as person of low status , so there is no future for public transport .
to tackle this problem we have to deliberately think about it .
thank you very much
Our life is keep changing everyday and we notice that huge range of the changing in each decades .
The lifestyle , technological material and the design of cars and houses keep changing annually .
We can admit that our life will be quite different from now to the fifty years later .
Changing is a natural habitat that makes the life more enjoyable to us .
It 's bringing the happiness to and the beauty to us .
For example , we can know the type of a car model by the changes that are made on it which it makes you idiotif the small new details in every model .
Even the kind of house panting can be changed by the time .
Now it is more colorful and designed in different ways Than it was at the past time .
We can not stop changing but we can guide it to the a special benefit which it makes the life easier and more comfortable .
Using the changing method would improve the education system in many aspects especially for people with obstruction .
It is bring the hope to their live and makes them taste the life in way that they had dreamed about it .
In conclusion , the changing of our life can help us to explore different benefits for the changing every decade .
It service the education and entertainment aspects in our life .
My town is very , very big with a lot of people .
More than 12 million people live in our town .
I ca n't say my town is the best place in the world .
The ecological problems are very important for the last years .
First of all - the air .
An enormous quantity of cars and the traffic jams provokes a pollution of air and smog .
The urban authorities can not change the situation cardinally .
But there is an active construction of new roads , road junctions and an improving of roads .
We do n't separate our rubbish .
All rubbish is taken away without separation .
But people are interested in it and this year I saw announcements about days of receiving of separate rubbish .
Our lawns also are the problem .
Several years ago we had wonderful lawns with a lot of local plants and grass .
But the last time the street - cleaners mow all the young grass .
Now our lawns are dirty and without grass .
But I hope our town will be better with our help .
I enjoy watching Tennis in my couch , is weird that I haven't played Tennis because where I live we do n't have that kind of sport , so I just can watch in my TV .
But I hope one day go to a tournament , travel to Spain and watch my favourite player who is Rafael Nadal from Spain .
Since the first time I watched him play , eight years ago was the same year that I started watch Tennis .
I like how the players moved through the court and how the audience applaused them every time they won a point , although I 'm not in the court I could feel the feeling of the game , it 's really awesome .
Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament , besides I watched and enjoyed it , also could learn how real the game was , which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no - reason , all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players , is one of the things that I want to make real .
My advice would be that I you want to play Tennis just go ahead play it , not expect till others do it , because you can do that too .
At the beginning it could be a little harsh , but is the same with many others sports when they start , so just keep in mind that you can play Tennis with the most talented players from the world overall .
Travelling by car is much more convenient .
In fact , I agree .
Btu , What about sharing a ride ?
Riding a horse is and old faschion way but still interesting .
Público transportation is excellent , you sabe money , tale care of the environment and make friemds .
Nowadays , Easter is associated more with the spring 's arrival than religious rituals .
People are more likely to take care of the gardening or shopping than participate in the celebration of Good Friday which makes the author connect Easter with a pagan spring festival .
Flamengo is the best team of Rio de Janeiro .
Flamengo was champion on 2009.In 2009 Flamengo has a great team with good players , but now it fight to finish the competition among the first 4 teams of championship .
My mouth is dry and have an awful metal taste , head aches , still slightly spinning and there is a terrible ringing in my ears .
All of these make me feel nauseous .
It must have been the aftereffect of whatever that clowns in masks have done to me . I want to shut down all the noises around , especially those whisper shouts coming from behind .
My best friend .
My best friend had always been like a sister to me .
Our mums had been to high school together , although they 'd never talked a lot .
The first time I met her , she insulted me , but I just did n't pay attention in what she had told me .
It was in school , when we were three years old only !
Even that , we start to talk more and more , until we were what we are nowadays .
She always helps me in whatever I need , and she 's amazing .
She 's always happy and laughing , and never gets angry when I get nervous !
She 's incredible , is like the sister I 'd never had .
In the other hand , she had never been a talktive girl , so it 's usually me who is always talking a lot .
Even so , now she starts to talk more often , and when we started high school we met lots of new friends !
In the future , I 'd like to continue being with her , and talking and having fun as we do together now .
I would n't imagine a life without her , she 's the best person I ever met .
My town was located along the middle coast of Viet Nam .
It is a really beautiful place and has a lot of scenery , such as the great beach besides a row tree , the obviously regularly weather ... Therefore taking care of the environment there is a vitally important mission of my town 's state .
When having an alarm about the pollution water , land ... by town 's civil , authorities must reposibile for this cause .
They often notify all the town 's civil that spending a free day on clearing all rubbish on the beach and on the roads of town .
Then , they will gather all rubbish to one place and burn or bury them .
Finally , state usually encourage on the radio , television etc .
It means that tourists and the people of town must have a crucial duty to protect the beach , the roads etc .
On weekends , I usually wear clothes depending on the weather .
If it is too cold outside , I put a jacket on , but if it is too hot I wear shorts , sandals , a light weight vest and sunglasses .
Sometimes , when I got to dress well , I wear dressy stuff , such as skirts , dresses , high heels and a sort of classy hairstyle .
When I stay at home , I can wear pyjamas all day long ( for example when I 'm sick ) Also , there are days when I want to go to the beach with my family , and so I put my bikini and a summer dress on .
Right now , I am wearing jeans , black flats , a gray shirt and a purple and turquoise hoodie .

In modern life , we rely on traffic to work or travel to everywhere .
It is conveninet to travel by private cars .The price of private cars which every one can afford it , so that everyone has the private car nowadays .Some people point out private cars are going to replace the public transport .
I could n't agree with the point of view for some reasons below .
Firstly , the growing number of private cars cause the big problem with traffic jam .People spend extra time on normal travel because of traffic jam .
That wastes people 's time and make people feel exhausted .
Not mention to say , it 's definitely hard to enjoy travelling in holidays .
Secondly , private cars are the main reason for the air pollution . We should consider the protection of environment for human future , not only care about the convenience we can see for now .
In the other hand , public transport system can reduce the amount of private cars in the busy area , like bus and tram .
People can travel through the city easily and safely .
For instance Melbourn , the secondary city in Australia where are trams via through the whole city area .
Therefore people do n't need to drive cars for travelling in the city .
The last point is people go for long journey by public transport .
Public transport bring relaxing holiday and efficient business trip to people without weary long drive .
For these reasons , it is unlikly there is no future for public transport .
On the contrary , We need more public traffice to improve our traffic system and find the better way to maintain the environment .
Alison read the note and it say 's " i 'll be back at 8 pm " .
It was 11 pm and her boyfriend was n't in their house , she started getting confused and temerously .
After waiting for 20 minutes , she decided to call the police ; they said " wait for the morning , maybe he went somewhere , now we ca n't help you " .
After that answer , she was n't satisfied so she decided to start calling all the hospitals of the area .
it was 4 am and she had none answer .
Alison felt desesparate , she notice that her husband 's car were in her house , so he was walking or someone pick up to him , she takes the phone and she call all him group of friends , nobody now anything and now they were scaried .
She was terrified , she starts thinking about the possibility of the death .
She got into her car and look for her husband for all their small city , Pentonville , after half an hour she saw him sleeping in a square .
George had lost her memory , and he could n't went back .
Nowadays , they are living a happy life and everyday Alison has to make him remember their life .
No future for public transport , it is one of problem if that fact .
now days , there are many type of transport in the world , bus taxi , train but train more conform then else , I always used bus in city .
if you to travel from city to city , public transport is cheaper than others .
my favorite sport is playing footboll .
I think that this sport is very happy .
Also , you could learn to be more friendly .
In my opinión , if you want to start to do this sport you could write a team . moreover , I think that it is good because you could help to lose wight .
The statement " public transport is our future " has been an interesting political discuss during years .
On one hand the public transport is good because it does n't pollute so much and you can muve around all the city .
Young people use it a lot .
We do n't use so much petroll like if we each of the passenger to use it own private transport .
In fact you ca n't use it if you have to carry a lot of things or when you have hurry .
In conclusion the public transport is very good and if it desapear it will be a big problem , is right that some times you need a private transport but apart from that the public transport is very use by people of all ages .
Transportation is very important in cities , villages as well as in sub - lines .
Many people has no vehicles , they only depends on public transport due to some reasons .
Any way in some cases , car is very useful to reach the destination very fast .
Public transport provide all the information about routes of the way which we are follow and give a idea to the passengers about the place .
Some times it may be very expensive due their taxes

First I would like to intoduce myself , my name is Joaquín Gutiérrez and I tell you why my favourite sport is football which is a sport than I have practiced since I was six years old .
I like very much this sport because it must be play with a gruop of people and is funnier than others sports which you play alone with other opponent , like tennis .
I have confessed that in the first time I did n't like it very much because I was a bit shy boy and I cost a lot of effort to integrate with the other players of the team but with the passage of the time I liked more and more .
Actually I play in the first divission of the club River PLate from Argentina .
I would like to advice for the children who give yours first steps in this sport that is which perseverance and effort you can achieve great treasures .
In the past , I did some exercises .
I have swum in the swimming pool and also I have cycle in my bicycle .
I have run upstairs so many times .
They 're healthy activities .
I went also , to the mountains with my family .
I ate a lot of fruit last year .
I loved the apples !
I always went to my school on foot .
But in summer I went by car .
Last year I gave some dolls of my sister to a charity .
I visited some friends of my parents and I wrote some letters to a friend .
Now , this year , I 'll do more exercises , I'll go with my family to the beach and swim in the sea .
I 'll eat better , I'll walk more , I'll walk more , do good things and speak more with my friends
Do you hear about Islam
What are your sources media or what ?
Can you ask yourself why we are here on earth to entertain or for what ?
Be honest with yourself
At first I would like to tell you that I do not agree with this statement . I could even tell that this opinion is opposite of the present and future situation .
As for me , even if travelling by car is so much more convenient , most people will always travel by a train , railway , bus and other types of public transport .
In my opinion people will travel by public transport more frenquely , because this type of transport is less expensive , more trustworthy and even more ecological than travelling by car .
In the other hand , we can say that it is really uncomfortable to travel by public transport , but even this we can improve in future .
We can discover new ways of travelling , take more care of our public transport and modernise them , so people would be motivated to travel by .
My trust in futuric technology is so enormous that I hope there are going to be a new ecological and cheaper ways to travelling around our world .
If this will happen , people are going to be more social and empatic , not even for peoples emotions , but also for our environment and they will treasure it .
To begin with , there are two ways of cutting down on pollution . which leads to global warming , that became a real threat of our life day by day .
Firstly , start to use renewable energy .
to illustrate , when we use the renewable energy we reduce emissions so , our natural resources will be conserved for our future furthermore sons future .
for example , using wind Energy or Solar Energy for electricity generation we will be used less fuel what is affected in emissions .
Secondly , we should improve our regulations that rules impose people lowering using things make a lot of pollution illustrate , using big vehicles or about building big facilities such as big factories .
As a result , ways to cut down on pollution . for instance , when one person uses a car for 6 people and many people do the same that make a lot of pollution for that we need to improve our regulations to make people use small cars for cutting down on pollution for a better future .
All in all , using renewable energy and improve our regulation is two ways to cutting down pollution for a better future .
Another thing we can do to a better future is avoiding war .
Because , war destroys mankind and countries .
Many wars start because , people do n't know or respect the other beliefs very well thus , we need to learn about belief other people we are live with them .
for example , the fight between Muslim and Hindus in India or in Lebanese civil war .
Secondly , do more cooperation between countries .
To illustrate , people should cooperation To intervene to bring peace to the world to stop the war in many areas like what United Nations doing .
For example , United Nations has taken the decision to ban mandatory weapons against South Africa because of racial persecution policy . in brief , knowing each other and do more cooperation between countries it is to ways to avoid war for a better future .
for that we need to improve our regulations to make people use small cars for cutting down on pollution for a better future .
All in all , using renewable energy and improve our regulation is two ways to cutting down pollution for a better future .
My most terrifying day was January 23rd , last year .
It was a normal Thursday .
I was at school : while I 'm listening to the English lesson I felt a strong headache .
After ten minutes I asked the teacher of called my parents for returned home .
At home , my dad and I had lunch , but my headache did n't finish .
At 2 p.m. my mum decided to go to the hospital because I ca n't undestood nothing and I ca n't talked .
On the hospital the doctor did me a drip and after some hours I felt better .
I do n't ever forget that day !
currently a very significant problem for its social and economic impact is the chaotic public transport in Lima .
To solve this problem Lima has been making long term strategies .
Lima is one of the cities with less road culture in the world .
we do not respect traffic rules to drive only with the intention to go fast as possible to our destination , this often causes traffict accidente and congestion .
For this reason people is becoming acure of the terrible problem and is learning and teaching vial culture to new generations .
Besides public institucions are promoting this and also private companies make advertising for awereness .
Lima is among the top ten cities have the messiest public transport in the world .
This is due to Lima in the beginning has not had a pant to desing its public road s and highways , and it only has been improvising to build their way without any criteria to transport its population .
Currently this issue is so important that governments are investing and working to create solutions such a metropolitan .
I think we have really become aware of the chaos of public transport and we have begun to design and implement strategies that in 20 years our reality improve our reality
In my opinion I believe the public transport will have future , because this transport is very necessary for the people .
In all cities of the world , the people will need the public transport to move around the city .
The people think that the public transport is only the bus , but the public transport is the bus , the taxis , train and subway .
Maybe travelling by car is so much more convenient , but there are a lot of cars and this car produce a lot of smoke and the nature is dying , if we do nothing , the nature will disappear .
I would like the people to take the public transport for travelling , so we will be able rescue the countryside .
I usually take the public transport for going to the University , because the public trasnport is cheaper than the car .
I used my car every day however few a few I started to take public transport for I can to save up money

One day , a little Egyptian boy read a book about Umrah .
He read about rites of pilgrimage and Kabaa .
After he finished the book , he wanted to go to the Kabaa and do rites of pilgrimage .
He closed his eyes .
He imagined he could fly like adragon .
Luckily , he remembered he had the dragon costume and he wore it .
As he pumped down the stairs , wings flapping cross Cairo .
He flied to Saudi Arabia .
Eventually he saw the Kabaa .
As he got closer , he saw alot of people around tha Kabaa .
They drank Zamzam water and wore Umrah clothes .
They was doing rites of pilgrimage .
One there , a man raised his hands and called to the God .
It 's amazing .
He had never seen anything so fantastic , but all too soon , it was time to leave .
He jumped and flapped and waved goodbye .
It had been fun day out but unfortunately he had to be home in the time for bed .
After he had arrived to home , he fell asleep and he started to think of his next adventure ..........
his new book was all about Paris .
My neighbourhood is a very pleasant area , it is big enough and it is so green .
The populations estimated around ten thousand person .
My neighbourhood surround by the large sequences of mountains which they have scenery view .
We got a large shopping centre with some local shop , you can obtain plenty of things that you want from it .
The One of the most amazing thing that attractive you , is that it has safari which is more enjoyable thing , at the sometime , it is introducing you to a wildlife without needs to go out from your city .
All amenities that is necessary for your daily life such as fantastic school with perfect teachers and modern building is found .
Transportation does not make a matter because it has got many bus lanes and bus stations .
It is not quiet and it is active city in a different ways .
If you like active city with enormous activity , I guess it is excellent place .
My favourite sport is badminton and I always get up early to play it every day . I like it becasue it is the best way to loss weight and get your health better than medicine .
I think someone should get exercise by starting play some favourite sport instead of watching TV or playing game .
The purpose of this propossal is to provide details abouts shopping facilities in my hometown , Vung Tau , and give some recommendations for tourists .
+ Local shops :
They had a long tradition dating back to the 18 century when Vungtau was a a small commercial port .
Not only are they well - known for its long tradition but it also famous for the hospitality of inhabitants living here which attract domestics and foreign tourists come here to see the famous sights as well as shopping for souvenirs .
They are closely located the local art gallery which take about 15 minutes to go by foot .
They offer a wide range of choice from souvenir items such as pictures , jewellries to local specialities with a reasonble price to suit different interests of people .
You can buy them as a small present to your family members or friends .
I assure that high - quality and various products there should be satisying your needs .
+ Shopping mall
It is conveniently situated in the town centre which takes 5 minutes to walk in a crow flies .
A lot of products such as consumer electronics , foods , souvenirs are sold here .
Compared with local shops , products ' price in shoping mall is considerably higher than that in local shops but it offers more varieties of products .
I highly recommend local shops to our tuorists for its cheap price and the hospitable manners of residents here .
Dear Mrs. Weber and Mrs. Schnappauf ,
good morning firstonce .
Now I 'll introduce myself .
My name is Yusuf Hamid I am 17 years old and I visit the state secondary school in Scheßlitz ,
tob e more precise , I am in the graduating class .
I come from Hallstadt , in close vicinity of Bamberg .
I have 1 older sister and 1 younger brother .
My hobbies are meet Friends and hangout with them or play baskteball in my spare time .
I 'm easily excited and nervous because this oral examination will determine wether i can do my A -level on the college of further education in Bamberg what i really want .
My favourite sport is play soccer .
It 's played by eleven players who try to score a goal during ninety minutes .
There is a grass floor , but it 's also played on artificial grass .
I really enjoy playing it because it 's very exciting because everything could happens .
I usually playing it with my partners and my friends which do the game even more fun .
I hardly recommend whoever to play soccer , because i 'm sure that they 're going to enjoy it very much .
It 's also a full sport because people will improve their health condition .
First I want to say is that people use the car like luxury objet , not as transport machine .
People spend their first salary to buy a car .
So , normally the use of the car is for pleasure .
Peolple do n't use the five seats of the car to go to travel .
From the point of view of the invaironment this is a bad idea because spend a lot of gas by person .
The cities are crowded and there are a lot of pollution with noises and smoke .
A new problem is being in the small cities , because they are not disigned to harbor a lot of cars .
I think that the main problem of the piblic transport is the infrastructure between villages and small cities , because they only exit between the great cities .
Some countries have a good net of intrastruture and people use then mainly , because the public transport is cheaper than the car and more quickly .
It is a problem of mentality , if we had born in a society that used the public pranspor I thought that is the better and we would use then normally .
In my own town , people do n't use public transport , some months ago the council gave a public sercice bike and three months later they had to close it .
It is a pity .
How can you celebrate new year in your country ?

The television can entertain , and also educate the people .
Have so many educacionals programs , like Animal Planet , and so many others .
Sometimes , some tv shows are so great that helps you in determinate class , for example , Animal Plante can help you in biology , The History can help in history , etc ... In my opinion the television can be good as books , and can also be a form of learning as good as only reads books , because TV is something fun , so you can learn and have fun at the same time .
Series also can help you to study , for me it helped me a lot because I love series and some q I watch helped me in school , such as breaking bad , which helped me in chemistry , and so many others .
last year I saw a movie called ' ' side by side '' , and talked a little of life in old history , and coincidence I was having this matter in school , then it helped me a lot .
in my opinion the television can entertain as can educate people on different ways .

Everyone says that our lifes are going to change in the future but that is what everyone says .
Right ?
In the future I really want my grandchildren to be happy that is all I ask for . I may be young but I think I do n't see myself living on earth in the next 50 years i mean dream does not hurt .
I question myself everyday how can i survive in this madness world ?
I do not know how to answer this question honestly but i guess i will never know .
I think that public transport has a great future because every time there are more people who use it .
However , I think it is very expensive but with a decrease in the cost there would be more people .
Nowadays have a car is very expensive because you have to pay a lot of thinks .
Public transport would have more future if it were better distributed .
Personally , I use more public transport but I hardly ever use private transport
Baja California is bigger than Aguascalientes for the beaches and tourist cities .
The transportation is practical because not all places are search , use more the car , truck and sometimes boat .
The tourist will never be able bored and will have much time to visit the city .
Baja California weather is not as cold as Chihuahua .
When you go to the beach you have across a large avenue to get there walking .
I 'm very tiring day , when I go and went straight to bed .
The last few days that I was in Baja California I 've got very little time for shopping and go to the beach .
Dear Jo ,
How 's it going ?
Well I think you have chosen the best idea , because there are
more places to visit in Italy .
First I believe you can travel from north of Italy to the south , in
order to see all the best places that we have , like Milan , Rome and
Lecce .
Find a job in Italy is n't as easy as you think , because the
economic system is in crisis , so it 's hard just for Italian , thinking for
foreign people .
But it 's not all , since you know two languages , maybe you can find
a summer work in a travel agency , because they need someone to
reception who can speak another language over Italian .
I will find out someone who know the agency 's manager , and you will
have sent me your curriculum after the weekend , because he will surely want it .
I 'm very glad to read you again ,
Ettore .

I think the car is more convenient for public transport .
In the car you do not have a timetable to be respected , you 're free to leave , to go home when you want ... not sit still to snow , rain , cold .
And without getting stuck in a city for delays for drivers . on public transport there is the possibility that you 're standing on the whole trip , there is always a lot of people , is cold in the winter and in the summer it 's too hot .
trips are longer on public transport or by car .
although I do not know if this would always choose the machine .
By reading the history , we can know that some disasters happened every the year of Jaiwu .
And there is no exception this year .
There happened several serious natural or man - made disasters in this year .
In Taiwan , a serious air crash caused by the bad weather happened first .
A terrible explosion resulting from carelessness followed .
A storm of food problems broke out next .
In the global , up to three air crashes which result from being hijacked or shot happened .
There were also conflicts between western countries and the ISIS .
In my opinions , all of us are supposed to be careful about all the details when we deal with everything to prevent disasters .
Additionally , all human beings should stop fighting and devote ourselves to pursuing a peaceful world .
Last but not least , we should do everything with our conscience .
Hope that the next year will be better .
Frankly it seems that the town that I have been living have not taken care about the environment .
It is easy to see when we walking around or when we go to some walk .
In general we do n't take care about nothing , water , recyclable things even our air conditioning .
This is such a chronic problem in all my country .
Here in Brazil is very difficult take care about it because it demands serious behaviour and skills from our gorvernants which unfortunatuly wo n't happens in a short time .
Although Brazil passed through several changes since last 40 years , the main one haven't started yet and I am talking about Education .
Our government prefer keep our population without information , because it is easier to manipulate their mind .
And why am I talk about it ? I am talk about it because the foundation of environment care is our minset , just with knowledge and information we will be able to manage actions to save , protect and improve the environment , and reverse we have the current result .
So if we believe it is a kind of important subject to take care , we need to move fast and our first step should be our election process .
A house is made of walls and beams ; a home is built with love and dreams .
this aphirism is famous and truth .
People try to build big and laxuries house but they forgot about the main .
it is warm which is needful for us .
we can have really good house where are many furniture , space and ornaments .
we can choice expencive things for interior .
but these things are not important if there is not comfortable atmosphere .
we have to invest our love , dreams , patient . and as a result we can create the best house ever .
building our house we make the most important place for us .
so we have to follow our dreams and create a warm and cosy place
In this report I am going to talk about how in my town take care of the environment .
First at all , I ask the council for this great problem which is the pollution and the way to solve it .
He is aware that the growth of the pollution is a big problem and that must be taken mesuares for trying to solve it .
It is not easy way but it is necessary to do it .
n the town he tries that the people have to aware about the sitiations and they take care the environment
On the other hand , the ask is if this solution could be enough or no .
The " green " organisations want to believe the problem is serious and that radical political solutions are needed .
In my opinion we should take conciencious and stop it , if we don , t stop it , after it will be later .
Me and my family .
I love my family , we argue hardly ever !
I do lots of activities with them ..
For example : we go to the restaurant , we go to see my brother 's football match , we eat or stay at home all together .
We sometimes do presents at the party like the Birthday ...
The best present that I receive was ... I do n't remebmer !
Another thing , at my home there are some rules : I and my brother tidy our room , we clean the bathroom when we use it , we ca n't eat in the sofà ..
I always try to follow rules but I sometimes break them because I 'm lazy !
I do n't argue with only one of my family .. I sometimes argue with my brother for television channels but we make up immediately .
With my parents I argue about school , how I use my mobile phone , how I speak with them ..
My last argue with my family was yesterday
I 'll talk about Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia , Riyadh City specialty .
First , you should know is the weather , we have a very cold winter and a hot summer compared with the other countries in the middle east .
If you want a city with sea you should choose any city in the west or east of Saudi Arabia .
Riyadh is the capital City it 's in the center of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia .
All the stores and malls are closed at mid night include the five prays breaks because we need to go for pray for work you need to know what the major you want to work in so I can help you to search for a good job matching you abilities .
after what I told you about my country I hope you like it .
I will write about my village .
My village has around 700 residents
My village is between a river and a mountain .
It has a lot of beautiful things how an old church of century XV but this church is in ruins but the new church also is very beautiful and comfortable .
My village has a wall of the stone , this wall was built by resident of the village in 1715 .
Other interesting place in my village is the square with his source
Also there the same supermarket , bar and restaurants .
For many years , people use public transport to go to work to study and to travel .
So , we use trains , buses and bikes to transport from place to place .
let us discover the aventadges and disavandges the
I think that a public transport will have future by the many reasons .
The car could be broken .
Man could have some problems with his health .
For example , if man had broke a leg , it might be hard to drive a car .
Also , for somebody it could be cheaper to travel by a bus , especially for a tourist from a foreign country .
Sometimes are better to travel by the bus because of thorny road .
Bus is one of the democracy transport , which is used by the students , kids , adults , rich and poor people .
When you are travelling with a big company , it is a best decision to travel by the bus .
Because everyone has a place in the bus .
And it 's funny and exciting to travel with the group by the bus .
Nowadays , people has a stressfull live so we ca n't spend time waiting for public transport .
We can think that there is no future for public transport because most of people use their own car .
Using your own car you can take the decision of what timetable is more convenient and what way your are go to use .
It 's more confortable go anyway with your own car , the problem is the pollution that this life bring us , and also the park problem .
If everybody go with their own car , their have to park and maybe the place is full .
Also , travelling by car is so much more convenient because you do n't have to go stopping in each town , so using your own town saves time .
Nowadays , people are really worried for their jobs due to the big financial crisis in which some people are lost their jobs and other are working in rubbish jobs for little money .
For all this , the question is too difficult to answer .
In my opinion , the most important is enjoy your work because we spent an average of nine hours in the office or in whatever work that we will do , as a result if you do n't feel comfortable , your life could be a hell .
The truth is , that the perfection would be that all people could work in their dream jobs and of course , making a lot of money , like for example Hollywood actors or football players but this is almost impossible .
In summary , for me , it is better enjoy at work every day , although you have not a big salary .
The most important is wake up each day with a big smile and work hard .
The scorch trials is one of the best films and thriller that I have ever seen , it is so exited all the thing that they do to survive in the outside world with all those people that are infected with a virus and the reason why they put them in the glade for them to be inmune if some sick person bite them .
one of the most amazing parts of the film is when Teresa calls Cruel for go for them and take them again to the Cruel building and like all of them does n't wanna go with them they start a war and they take Mihno with them and at the end Thomas decide to go after them and he give a super great speech for all the persons go with them and help him to get back Mihno , and what i really want to see in the next film is that if Thomas is mad at Teresa ( i never like her ) and if they get free and the world comes back to the normal world .
Ecotourism Bacalar Quintana Roo .

It is a beautiful place to go on your free time and get to know it .

Recently , I have seen the Tarantino 's new film , Django Unchained , and I have to recognize that I am looking forward to watch the next one .
He took down every mistake he made last films .
Firstly , Django Unchained remembered us the hard life suffered by black people in the past , due to a great introduction without dialogues , where black people were unchained while they came back to be selling to an owner farm , it being matching with an amanzing soundtrack as identity Tarantino 's films .
Nowadays , In many country the youth looking for doing sports to be fitness and very active there are many sports to join it .
On the other hand , there are some arguments for sport specially volleyball .
When I play volleyball I totally forget all my problems and focus on nothing but volleyball and the intensity of the game .this game i like to play .
The kind of stress that pushes me to work harder in order to get good at what I love .
In addition to this It pushes me to keep on trying so that I can get everything right .
It 's all about will power and the absolute want to get better .
On the one hand , there are alot of famous player on volleyball who had Knee ligament injuries , The most frequent mechanism of injury was landing from a jump in the attack zone .
In addition to this , Injuries were more frequent during games than training .
In my opinion , Volleyball must then be considered among high - risk sports according to the frequency and gravity of our surgical findings.my advice for who starts this sport you will get fresh after you play this game and makes you doing your work in relaxetion way .
I believe there are numerous possibilities on public transport because cars and public transport play completely different roles in our society .
First of all , public transport probably meets the demands of people who hardly or do n't use their cars to travel .
In Japan , which has one of the largest population over 60s , many senior people prefer to use buses to cars .
In addition , a new generation appear and they do n't own their cars because of a few opportunities to travel and high cost of having a car on their own .
Second , public transport provides a quick and easy way to visit unfamiliar places with us .
It is not necessary for us to know in advance how to get to the destination before the departure by using public transport .
So it prevents us to open maps to confirm every single route .
Lastly , we can use less resources by using public transport .
When it comes to our environment , the use of transport could be a solution for reducing the emission of CO2 .
Because of these reasons , I see a blight future for public transport .
it is out of the question the take care of the environment is regarded as turning point in our life .
it is upstearm that irrigates our economic life . and no doubt that Negligence has the ability to destroy many good sides in our life .and our government is doing her best to put end to negligence .
but we also must coparation to save our town . on the other hand we must Presentation awareness program for all people .
and we must throw rubbish in the street to keep the area clean and we must Maintain clean trees to keep the area attractive thus we can improve National income by attracting many people from other town . and we must lern children that clean is necessary for their health and on their school they should throw rubbish on Waste basket and who throw it on the ground Will be punished . to top it all we ca n't go without Cleanliness of our town .
Natural environment destroyed that is a people focus on frequently problem .
Many countries build more and more buildings affect people quality of life .
Setting up more large building can destroyed people and animals live environment and some animals maybecan extinction .
Governments should do some measures to deal with build more buildings will destroy the ecological environment .
There is no future for public transport , becasue travelling by car is so much more convenient .
I 'm not agree abaout this statement becasue in a big cities there are a lot of cars , if all people in a city use his own car at the same time , there will be a huge traffic , so travelling by car is n't much more convenient in this situation .
There are more problems in big cities , one of them is parking , there are a lot of areas in a city that is very difficult to park , and you only have 2 options , you can park in a private parking and pay a lot of money or you can waste you time searching for a place of parking .

I am was asking to me if you want to go to the party with me ?
what you think ?
the party is the next week on Julias house , it is going to start at 5:00 pm
My favorite sport is swimming .
I engaged in swimming in nine years old .
I had gotten first prize in a match .
As a result , I think that I have some intellent on swimming .
Since then , I meet my teacher in the pool .
She teach me a lot of things , and be the most important figure in my life .
She is a doctor , she told me that swimming will let my body more better .
From then on , I fell my disease in decreasind and fell relax .
Consequently , I need to swim usually .
First of all , swim can help your health .
The research declined that swim can decrease disease .
Second , swim can relax yourself .
When you in the water , you will feel relax .
Third , swim can get more friend .
You can go to the swimming club , that is a way to meet people with interesting of same .
You can try this sport from now on .
Running
I am fond of running !
Many people think running is a wasting time or it 's very difficult but I do n't agree .
Firstly , you will be stronger , enduring .
I started with three kilometers for one jog .
Now my average jogging is 8 - 10 kilometers and going on 40 - 50 minutes .
My best result is 15 km , but I guess awhile .
Secondly , you will be healthier .
I am less having a cold .
Even if I have a cold , I will get out and will run 4 - 5 km .
After that on the next day , I feel myself better .
Four years ago I had often cold and recovery long period .
Now I have more energy and health to become happier .
Thirdly , you will be more confident .
I started running four years ago .
Cause of this was hurt my leg .
After rehabilitation I continued feel hurt in my foot and I still limped .
I decided to stop this and one gorgeous morning I starting running !
As result , I know the men can be harder than can be seem .
After these moments , you starting doing things that many people think impossible or even unbelievable .
My recommendations for beginners .
1 ) Improve yourself in a gradual way .
I advise start from one km .
2 ) Work systematically .
Two - three jogging in a week is norm for beginners .
3 ) Grow up .
First week one km , second one km and 300 meters etc .
4 ) Think about your initial physical conditions .

Is Physical Education necessary at schools ?
First of all , It is true that not all the people like do sports because they are heavy and a bit stressful too .
We can also say that there are other subjects more important than Physical Education , like Biology or History .
However , Physical Education is necessary because makes people less lazy .
Despite the fact that sports are heavies , doctors are always saying that sports improves our health .
Schools have Physical Educations for teach this good habit since our childhood .
In conclusion , Physical Education are necessary at schools because sports improve our health and make us feel good and healthy .
