S One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community , in 1958 .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty - three .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powers , which it can use to adopt acts , having the force of national law .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called " integration " .

S All of the member states agree in principle to the idea of a single market by 1992 , however each wish their own interests to be safeguarded .

S This is to say that none want to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many want unanimous voting , not majority voting .
