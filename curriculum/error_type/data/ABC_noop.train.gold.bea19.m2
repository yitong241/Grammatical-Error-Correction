A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Last but not least , the internet is for fun .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Indeed , using public transport is not only unsafe and uncomfortable , but also unhealthy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Especially in New Zealand , there are some beautiful islands and you can get to them by ferry easily .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One way to reduce those negative consequences is to foster the use of public transport .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Public transport is a more efficient way of using energy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , public transport lacks some advantages only found when using our own car .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , they allow us to travel fast by road , mostly to the exact place we want to go .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They carried out a series of daring robberies against corrupt business leaders during their performances , sharing out the stolen money with their audiences .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Let me explain it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If you do n't like films that make you think , this film is not for you .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , if you are looking for a film that is extremely gripping and can keep you guessing , it 's definitely the right choice for you .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They can also have constant mood changes and high levels of nervousness , since they may have lost many hours of sleep whilst studying for a certain exam .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We are all looking for that without great difficulty or effort and one way to achieve this goal is to study abroad .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Public transport or travelling by car ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Overall , it can be seen that the city has became more modern , with more transport and entertainment facilities .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One striking change is that a new station has been built , to connect the north of the city with the city centre and the road has been pedestrianized .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The urban areas were demolished , to make way for skyscrapers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I like playing tennis .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Unfortunately , a lot of people are interested in others .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These happenings are not strange .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Society thinks that they haven't got weakness and lack of ability .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Public transport is for many people to go to the same place .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S More money can be saved as the cost can be shared with the people who are going to the same place .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Third , public transport is good for the environment .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Later , the USA government affirms they do not want to conquer Cuba , but they demand Spain to sign an armistice with Cubans .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The Pope requests the Spanish army to cease immediately the hostilities in Cuba .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Keeping a Promise
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 'll show if you can be trusted or not .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And then I always have a lot of promises to keep , and it also makes me too busy to keep them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That way you wo n't have lots of pressure , and you can be an honourable person .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I 'm also glad that you want to visit my country . You 'll find that it is a very beautiful one .

S In addition , scientists and engineers are working hard to invent and improve the vehicles , so they become less harmful to the environment .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The second argument is more related to everyone and has great influence .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For those who do not drive , public transport is extremely important .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Not everyone can afford it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We can say for sure that stars and celebrities are also people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It does not matter what amount of money is in their accounts .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They are not able to buy real relationships such as friendship and love .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We all go through hardships and failures .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But this should not reach a level that it lets us fall into mental disorders .

S Another great reason for knowing languages is that people will like and respect you .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You will also develop your mind and learn new things .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So knowing a lot of languages could be very useful in life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , learning languages is not always practical .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It turns out that learning a foreign language may be pointless .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So it 's nice to know other languages , but just those you will really need .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Dear Sir or Madam ,
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I could also share with everyone some Spanish recipes .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Whether movies and TV programs made in our own country are more interesting than movies and programs made in other countries has been widely discussed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Many people are of the opinion that domestic movies and TV programs are better than foreign ones .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , I strongly assert that movies and TV programs made in other countries are better for the following reasons .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To begin with , foreign movies and TV programs are more stimulating .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Additionally , people can learn more things from foreign TV programs and movies .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In contrast , some people consider that domestic films are more familiar than foreign ones .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In sum , although there are some dissenting views , one can still safely come to the conclusion that foreign films and TV programs are more interesting than domestic movies and TV programs .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the one hand , most people have , at least , one television in their homes , so it is very accessible to everyone .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Especially with their mothers , girlfriends or wives .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Without spending money , we can get inspired by new collections or people that we see in the city .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I can understand people who say that shopping is boring .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Especially when we go from shop to shop but we ca n't find anything interesting .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We need shopping .

S Her voice was weak and shaky .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It has been such a long time since we wrote to each other .

S You never told me that you were thinking of playing an instrument .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S What kind of instrument are you going to play ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In my opinion , you should try to organise a schedule for your activities .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In fact , I am studying a lot to pass the CAE examination ( Certificate in Advanced English ) , but I am facing several difficulties .

S Also for this reason , I have chosen to spend this period in a family .

S Mary and Amber were having lunch at a restaurant .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The stories of Stephanie and Ali in Rust and Bones , and Pat and Tiffany in the Silverlinings Playbook all began with their lives going through life - altering events .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Ali , an unemployed father in his mid-20s who is struggling to make ends meet and support his young son , saves Stephanie and helps her get back on her feet .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Similarly , Pat and Tiffany were also going through hard times when they first met .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Once again , their relationship began as friends and transforms into love as they help each other conquer personal challenges .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In addition , love is portrayed in different ways in these two movies .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Silver Linings Playbook , as a Hollywood movie , describes the love story in a hilarious tone .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We should n't underestimate the importance of societal and environmental problems .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They both must be solved because of their great negative influence on the world .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S People always use nature and its resources to satisfy their needs .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These issues are so burning in developing countries .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That 's why I consider that societal issues are the most dangerous .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , developing countries can not protect the environment because of their poverty , low incomes , and population illiteracy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Such disasters as earthquakes , floods and tornados affect a lot of people every year .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If people take responsibility for their actions , we will avoid plenty of consequences .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We must have strong leaders who will strive for a beautiful world .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S People ca n't satisfy their limitless needs ; they think only about their wealth .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This exchange program will give me the required knowledge that I can use effectively to develop Ukrainian society .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Having said that , we just need to remember to be aware of what we want to receive from TV while we are choosing a program to watch and be happy with our choices !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Pros and cons - cars in major city centres
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Moreover , cars pollute the air significantly and it becomes unhealthy for breathing .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Some drivers are not keen on this ban , because this is inconvenient for them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S How does Shakespeare make ' A Midsummer Night 's Dream ' magical ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's almost a love triangle !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The misuse of magic is when it causes an argument between the Athenians .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This whole dispute could have been avoided if not for Puck 's mistake .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Without the misuse of magic , the plot would n't be the same .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In this play , the fairies are almost like the heart of the book .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The fairies also affect nature as Oberon 's and Titania 's dispute results in the wind ' piping ' to them in ' vain'(2:1:88 ) .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It creates unreality and fantasy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As a reoccurring theme , Puck 's use of magic creates humour , conflict and balance in the play .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Puck 's magic also adds to his naughty , cheeky , attractive character in this play .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This also leads to more humour as Titania falls in love with Bottom and calls him her ' sweet love'(4:3:30 ) .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It also creates the comparison of Titania , a beautiful , delicate creature , whilst Bottom is completely grotesque .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The idea of Titania having a ' flowery bed'(4:1:1 ) and the idea of Bottom , at that time , looking ' monstrous ' and ' strange'(3:1:91 ) creates a distinction .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore , he is shown as a sympathetic character .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , Oberon also uses his magic to get the changeling boy from Titania .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When Oberon finds out that Puck has transformed Bottom 's head into a donkey 's head , he gets annoyed at first at Puck 's mistake but later realizes that Titania has fallen in love with a ' vile thing'(2:2:40 ) , a man with an ass ' head .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Titania 's fairies are also characters who use magic . They use it to protect their ' fairy queen'(2:2:12 ) from ' spotted snakes with double tongue ' , ' newts and blindworms'(2:2:9 - 11 ) .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The clothes of the fairies and their lives are also magical .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The place where Titania sleeps is full of ' oxlips ' and ' eglantine ' .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She sleeps on a bower and she wants a fan made of wings of butterflies .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The language of the fairies creates magic by imagery that is absolutely exquisite .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Most of us probably haven't heard of ' oxlips ' ( 2:2:250 ) and ' woodbine'(2:2:251 ) .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Shakespeare 's choice of words creates this .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He talks about ' musk - roses'(2:1:252 ) and ' wild thyme'(2:2:249 ) giving us this image of this beautiful land , with green grass and all sorts of flowers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This image will probably look like where the fairies live or associate it with a fairy tale .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S By doing this , we begin to realize the magic in this play .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In ' A Midsummer Night 's Dream ' there are many spells , e.g.
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Flower of this purple dye ,
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Hit with Cupid 's archery ,
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Sink in apple of his eye .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When his love he doth espy ,
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Let her shine as gloriously
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As the Venus of the sky .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When thou wak'st , if she be by ,
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Beg of her remedy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S OBERON(3:2:102 - 109 )
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The language used in this spell contains many references to nature ( ' Venus ' and ' Sky ' ) .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Just by reading this , you can imagine this fairy king chanting a spell on a purple flower called ' love in idleness ' and you can understand Cupid ( the Greek god of love ) had blessed this flower with his archery , giving you an understanding that this is a love potion .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Shakespeare has also used metaphors and similes such as ' let her shine as gloriously as the Venus of the sky ' to create the thought that Helena should look like a ' goddess , nymph , ' in addition to being ' perfect ' and ' divine'(3:2:137 ) .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The fairies recite their sentences as if they were a poem or song . '
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Spotted snakes ' and ' Thorny hedgehogs'(2:2:9 - 10 ) are references to animals .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Animals , insects and plants are commonly referred to in ' ' A Midsummers Night 's Dream ' and these descriptions add to the magic .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It creates the sense that the fairies thought that the animals were dangerous and the way they describe them engages the reader .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The description of the animals and insects makes them seem as if they were evil spirits to the fairies and spirits are magical .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This play also refers to ' sleep ' and dreams .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Thinking of it as a dream creates innocence and vulnerability .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Also , the thought of all four lovers having the same dream makes it seem strange and magical to them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Also , Shakespeare uses the thought of plays .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Potions are also used to show a sense of magic .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In the human world , they did n't use spells or potions .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The effect that ' love in idleness ' has in the play , creates the plot and so potions play a main role in the book .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Without magic , the play would not have the same elements of humour .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Also , the absence of magic would alter the overall plot .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The repetitive theme of magic plays a significant role in the play .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To summarize my points , I personally think that Shakespeare presented magic in the play by using thoughts such as transformations , spells , potions and aspects that do n't exist in the human world .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Shakespeare has done it again !

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Because there can be a lot of differences in the characteristics of those two subjects .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Because the numbers of theory lessons about our discipline are by far many hours less than I expected to get .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So the details and information they teach you will be more useful in your future career than the random information about the subjects at school .

S The world where we live now is more suitable for young people , as many could say and prove , even though , in some countries , older people can have a decent life without depending on young people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But , unfortunately , the new gadgets can be very difficult to manage or master , especially for the part of the population who did not learn about them while they were children or students at the university ( older people ) .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The older people are limited in their abilities to use technology that could be valuable to provide enjoyable times at home , on the street , in a museum , etc .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Since last century , the world population is more present in the bigger cities , which , as a result , have been increasing in size and in problems .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The mobility of older people is certainly reduced if compared with a younger person .

S Which of these is better ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We may think that depends on how you like to travel , as they all have their advantages and disadvantages .

S There are some clubs in the town : the A 's and the Subway , which are in the centre , and the Barrel , which is on the outskirts of the town .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You definitely have to visit it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Moreover , people can use their humor to overcome some difficult issues .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Moreover , we can feel happy easily .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Consequently , we feel happy so easily because my friend has a good sense of humor .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Finally , great marketing is a necessary measure in order to succeed in business .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Finally , people have more relationships in life as well as in business .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A bigger wedding is required to meet this change .

S They can simply travel when they choose and not be tied to a timetable that has been devised out of their control .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I was walking in the center of Turin when I saw a big , beautiful hotel , with a lot of police who were trying to maintain law and order because there were a lot of people like me that wanted to know what was going on .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I saw a policeman who was my friend and he explained to me that a man had been killed by someone and he allowed me to go into the room and see the scene of the crime .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I went to see the room of this poor man , called Mr Smith .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S All the room was in order and the policeman explained to me that the man , who had been very old , had also been rich .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She opened the room with some keys that all the waitresses have , and saw Mr Smith lying dead on the floor .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The detectives analysed what was in the glass and it was poison .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I think that someone who wanted to inherit Mr Smith 's money must have killed him for this reason .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So he must have killed him with the poison .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Nobody wants to dismiss the importance of television and its achievements .

S Then , disaster struck .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S While the fire was spreading all over the bedroom , I woke up and Matxi was unconscious because there was a lot of smoke in the bedroom .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Fortunately , we managed to wake her up .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That day I was afraid , but now I remember this experience as a good time .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The metro , which is a means of public transport , solves all these problems .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One should n't forget that using public transport helps to save money .

S It was a beautiful Sunday morning and Michael was preparing to go out to meet his old friend Peter .

S He managed to get the money and take the car from his dad and went to pick up Peter .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Alison read the note , smiled and immediately put on her coat .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Someone would write something short and simple like " Keep smiling " or " You 're beautiful " and leave the note on the mirror right behind the front door .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Just to make her smile every single morning as if something amazing had happened to her .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But truth was that she was jealous .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Very , very jealous .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Because it 's just the way Tom is - stubborn and righteous .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Alison , well ...
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She was weak , but preferred to be called fragile , as if that made a significant difference .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The swimming pool is big enough and the temperature of the water is fine .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The new tennis court was found very useful because most members of the club claimed that they liked playing tennis .

S Many years had passed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Alice had decided to return to her homeland .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is indisputable that advertising has become a permanent fixture in our daily lives .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Once a curious novelty that was largely considered a harmless addition to our sometimes dull and overly familiar environment , it was welcomed as fun and informative .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was also - if one wished to do so - relatively easy to ignore .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But we have now entered a new era of the attention - grabbing business : its digitalisation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The line graph illustrates the amount and type of fast food eaten by teenagers in Australia between 1795 and 2000 .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As an overall trend , it is clear that consumption of fish and chips decreased over the period while the amount of pizzas and hamburgers eaten increased during the same period .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Then , there was a slight increase to about 95 times per year in 1985 .

S On the other hand , cars are not only expensive to purchase , they also require fuel , which is very expensive .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Statistically speaking , car accidents are much more frequent than plane crashes or train accidents , so public transport is not only cheaper sometimes , but it 's also safer and faster .

S One of these places is , undoubtedly , Kazimierz , the Old Jewish district of Cracow .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First , you should visit the New Cemetery .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was established in 1800 .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Then , you really must visit the synagogues : The Temple Synagogue , Isaac Synagogue , The Tall Synagogue and Remuh Synagogue .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The synagogue is still being used as a place of prayer for the few remaining Jewish people in Cracow or for visitors from Israel or other parts of the world .

S If you are a good browser you may find some original souvenirs of Cracow to take home with you .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I think the Kazimierz is one of the most beautiful places in Poland .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's appealing and full of this eerie spirit of the past .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Specifically , they learn to take responsibility when taking care of pets .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I have therefore fostered a sense of responsibility since then .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So , according to my personal experiences , I think that children can benefit from keeping a pet .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Some people might argue that it is always parents who take care of the pets most of the time , instead of children themselves .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Namely , parents always do things for children , such as housework , homework , even taking care of the pets for their children .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Nevertheless , what those people have claimed is a digression from the topic here .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Why children can not learn is because of their parents , not because of the pets .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In other words , taking care of pets is absolutely beneficial to children so long as they are given an opportunity .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Moreover , children can also learn to sympathize with others by keeping a pet , apart from leaning to be responsible .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Thus , keeping pets does enable people to be able to put themselves in others ' shoes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , if children are not allowed to keep a pet , the parents will have to come up with other ways to make the children both responsible and sympathetic .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We always believe that a city should never compromise the environment for the sake of development .

S Nothing is more difficult than changing one 's mindset given people 's inertia .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Hence , we have incorporated the concept of environmental protection into our curriculum so that students can develop an awareness of the matter at a young age .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Different activities , including seminars and exhibitions have been held in different districts to spread the message of environmental conservation across the community .

S There are huge positive effects of eating fast food .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , fast food is unhealthy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Facebook is the most popular social networking site of all time .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I would n't consider myself against it , although I am aware of the risks .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First of all , I think Facebook , for example , is a great way for shy people to socialize , because it can boost their self - esteem , considering the fact that they do n't have to meet anyone face - to - face .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's also great if we want to manage our friendships , or create new ones .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Social networking sites also benefit those who have " unusual " hobbies or those who have a hard time finding people with similar interests .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , we are also exposed to many risks , such as cyberbullying or online predators .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Spending too much time on the internet also has harmful effects on our family lives , because we tend to forget how important it is to spend time with those who love us .

S Dear Camp Director ,
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I have always wanted to be part of something like this .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I am also very cheerful and energetic , and am very good at organising fun activities .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is certainly true and corresponds with my experience .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Some people do manage to stay in the same place all their lives and even work for the same company , while others are much more mobile in terms of their jobs and homes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In the past , it was the norm for people to live in a limited geographical area all their lives and be involved in the same type of occupation all their working lives .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There was simply no alternative to this , especially if you lived in an agricultural society .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , with the rise of industry and specialized companies , it became possible for workers to move jobs , often to places far away .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Following on from this , as a society 's wealth increased , people had skills and training to allow them to be much more selective about which employer they want to work for and choices about how and when they wanted to change the type of job they wished to do .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S that people take for granted and regard as perfectly normal .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S With the opportunity for change comes choice , although circumstances , economic and personal , can often force people to do what they might not normally choose .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore , it happens that some people want change in their lives but are not able to effect it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This might be because they have strong obligations to family , might need to look after someone or might simply not have marketable skills to find a livelihood somewhere else .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There are others , of course , who are quite happy to live and work in the same place all their lives because they do not think moving would enhance their lives .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Some are happy to stay put because they would find it very stressful to endure change .

S 2 . METHOD : DATA SELECTION
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We are going to compare the lyrics from the following three songs : Miley Cyrus ' Wrecking Ball ; Anastasia 's Left Outside Alone ; and Taylor Swift 's Back to December .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We have chosen these three songs because they all deal with the same topic of breaking - up , but they describe this topic from different points of view , even though the three songs are performed by female singers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is the case of the " free choice " song , Taylor Swift .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Also , we think that these songs can represent different kinds of processes and language we have seen in class .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The material processes are also known as the processes of doing .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is because they express an action or an activity .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This type of process has been found in the three songs and it is very prolific .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Usually , in these types of songs , the performers describe actions in the relationships as well as at the end of it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The material processes are carried out by agents , which coincide with the subject .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The subject of the sentence can also be the force if the agent is inanimate .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In this category of processes , there is another participant known as the affected , because the action of the verb affects or concerns it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S SONG ANALYSIS :
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The main participants are the woman and the man .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Maybe she feels bad , but not completely guilty .

S This sentence shows a girl who thinks she is not really bad , though she knows she could have done things better .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Obviously , she ca n't say a bad thing about him , but we do n't really know what he thinks about her .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You need to invest your time and energy in it so as to achieve results .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There is a lot of stress associated with it , bearing in mind that in most cases a new language will revolve around a culture that is different from what you are used to .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Enthusiasm to learn is all that you will need so as to get the first few steps done .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This might suggest that being surrounded by people at work with whom we need to socialize would have more of an effect on our emotions .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , people are willing to discuss serious matters with their family and friends because of their shared bond of trust .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Conversely , we share our deepest worries and problems with our close family and friends because we are not afraid of exposing our weakness to those people whom we trust .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S At the same time , we will also pay more attention to the people whom we love .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's true that there are lots of repeats on TV and there may be many programmes you regard as poor quality .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In addition , the price of watching television for a whole month is much lower than the price of tickets for the cinema to watch a film for only two hours .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Moreover , when you sit in front of the TV in your own house , you wo n't get irritated by strangers , which may happen in the cinema .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But after a while he thought about something bigger , huge and more expensive .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He had already thought about that so he grabbed a blindfold and put it over Elena 's eyes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In front of her was a stunning house .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was enormous , with huge windows , white walls and with superb views of the sea and the shore .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She also appeared to be relieved that she would n't have to live with her parents anymore .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S After that memorable moment , she could now have a thrilling life next to the person she loved .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They lived happily ever after .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He carefully chose the clothes he was going to wear .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He chose a blue tie and a light grey suit .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It took him twenty minutes to do his hair .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Michael always thought that this little ritual gave him an extra piece of luck .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He went out of his little apartment and walked full of confidence to the bus stop .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He thought happily that he was not only on his way to his new job but he was on his way to his new life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He knocked on the door .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A woman 's voice answered .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This magnificent building is situated in the city centre and it was built seventy years ago in an ancient palace .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You can buy all you can imagine there but one of them is really extraordinary .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You are listening to your favourite music .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The temperature level is exactly what you like .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Well , there can be some pretty girls among the passengers for sure , but it 's far too often that you will have to sit near some stinky bum .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S More than that , the car is always there when you need it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S No , not at all !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You wo n't be able to cover such a distance in one day .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So I 'd have to say this .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There is no easy way to carry our weekly shopping , stuff for the gym or instruments on public transport .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We try to steal minutes from every hour to find time to do all the things we want to do .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Dear Paul ,
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I hope you 're doing well and everything is ok .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I 'm writing to you because I want to tell you about my experience .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Starting from sending the invitations to the most famous people in the city and calling the shots .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I had to check their work and correct their mistakes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Speaking of which , it was n't easy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I think I did my best .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another good thing is that I had a chance to talk to journalists .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They came from different parts of the world .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S By the way , do you know Jess Morrow ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She 's a journalist from the New York Times .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She 's very famous and I told her everything she wanted to know about the show .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S XYZ
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S My father has had a boat for as long as I can remember , so I 've been sailing since I was a little girl .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I guess because I 've been practicing for such long time , I do n't agree in either case .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S and it can be dangerous too , if one does n't know how to move on a boat .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If you take the time to ask around , you 'll find out that a lot of the most experienced sailors never took classes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I would not say that there is no future for public transport .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Our monthly fuel expenses can be reduced by using public transport to get to the workplace .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is possible that we will stay in Athens about ten days .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Are you able to arrange activities and local transportation for us ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Introduction
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Problems with the current website
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Ways to address the issues
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I think the website needs to be revamped to attract more users .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The look and feel should follow the " material design " standards as they are defined by Google and should use more modern fonts .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As for the server and database administrators , they should immediately resolve the issues regarding the backend part of the website .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Recommendations
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I would like to make the following recommendations :
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Develop a better feedback system so users can express their concerns and questions in a more detailed way .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I assure you that if these recommendations are implemented , the website will improve significantly .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She had just got the job and she wanted to show what her skills were .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So she left on Monday and she landed in Bogotà Tuesday .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Never had she seen such a high waterfall .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Sport is probably as old as humanity itself .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Sport not only helps people to become strong and to develop physically but also makes them more organized and better disciplined in their daily activities .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Sport helps people to keep in good health .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Needless to say that sport plays a very important role in our life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's popular among young and old people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Many people do morning exercises , jog in the morning , train themselves in fitness clubs and gyms , and take part in sports competitions .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Other people like sports too , but they only watch sports competitions , listen to sports news .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There are summer and winter kinds of sports .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You can choose a sport for any season and for any taste .

S I 'd like to describe some of them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In spring and summer many people prefer to go in for jogging .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There are a lot of football teams , football events , and fan clubs in almost every country of the world .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Many people today go in for extreme sports .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is also known that extreme sports help to build character and form a strong personality .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These activities usually involve speed , height and a good level of physical training .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It also develops patience and self - control , and helps to control your fear .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S More importantly , it gives the sense of achievement .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Let 's consider some kinds of extreme sports .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Take bungee jumping .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You jump off a bridge and you fall and fall , and then , just before you hit the ground or water , an elastic rope pulls you back .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Ice diving is for those people who are absolutely crazy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You put on diving equipment and dive under a frozen lake .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And , if that 's not enough , you try to walk upside down on the ice !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A lot of people are not fit nowadays .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's a big problem today .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Good health is better than the best medicine .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This kind of sport is very elegant .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You should control your body very well if you wish to skate gracefully .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I should n't call myself a sports fan .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Of course , I watch sports competitions on TV from time to time , like swimming or running .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I admire extreme kinds of sport .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I think they are really cool .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I admire people who dare to do such sports .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Television is not an issue of general consensus .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is definitely a way of spending our free time .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , does it teach us something ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Does it help us grow and improve our knowledge ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the one hand , it is said to help people to spend quality time as they can learn about the most varied subjects from the comfort of their homes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is possible to watch documentaries , the news , concerts , plays and learn about current affairs .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The characters in charge of the four magicians are Jesse Eisenberg , Isla Fisher , Dave Franco and Woody Harrelson .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The shots of Las Vegas , New Orleans , Paris and New York are wonderful , and the fact that nothing is computerized at the time to witness the magic tricks it absolutely amazing .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Also , aliens did not get me and practice surgery on me .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Since I did n't discover that I am , in fact , a wizard , I could n't get a magic wand .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Being normal gets old and not being a wizard is shabby .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I did not see the planets nor meet any sexy alien girl from Saturn .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Staying at home all day is regrettable and not being kidnapped by aliens gets really boring .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S No one likes being " unfamous " and I do n't like not being Lady Gaga 's friend .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Watching " as in heaven , in hell " was hilarious although it is a horror movie .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Finally , the holidays have started .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Just a few more days and then we will be on our way to our holiday destination .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It will be our third time at this campsite .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The campsite borders on a small lake which can be quite cold , even in summer .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , we usually do not let this stop us from going into the water .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We like to visit the cities and various sights in the area .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One of the sights we definitely want to see is the former border between West - Germany and East - Germany .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We also like hiking and are planning on doing that a couple of times per week .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The region where we will stay has a nice system that encourages people to hike .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S At some point during your hikes you can collect stamps in a special booklet .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For somewhat younger children this is a nice incentive to participate in these hikes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We will probably stay at this campsite for about three weeks and besides the hiking we will read and laze about .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Hello ! My name 's Vanesa , I 'm 33 and I really enjoy watching soap operas .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These days I watch a lot of different soap operas , though my favourite one is -and will always be- Friends .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The plot is about six young people ( they 're about 26 ) : Ross , Rachel , Monica , Chandler , Joey & Phoebe .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They live in New York City and have a lot of comical and romantic adventures , all of them related to their friendship .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S What could I say about the characters ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Well , Ross is a paleontologist that works in the Natural History Museum , and he 's Monica 's older brother .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Chandler is the funny guy and he works as a stock agent .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And finally we have Phoebe , a veggie and bohemian girl who enjoys singing and playing the guitar and who works as a massage therapist .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This story continues until the end of the soap opera , when Ross and Rachel finally have a child ( Emma ) .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But there are a lot of funny stories , like Phoebe having her stepbrother 's children , or Joey becoming a great soap opera actor .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I recommend ' Friends ' to everyone .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I think it 's the best soap opera ever made .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Oh my God !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Today is the day . I have been told that I will be moving to my new apartment .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Good news !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But , wait !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It will also mean not having access to the Internet for a month !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Will I survive ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Will my life be the same ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First of all , I have to say that I totally depend on the Internet .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Secondly , I have many friends living abroad . I communicate with them using Skype .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Will I need to use the phone instead ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Unlike the Internet , phone calls are really expensive .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I am not sure if I could afford it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Will I find myself writing letters ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another thing to consider is not having that open window to the world .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In conclusion , my life will be completely changed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Michael was a person that was afraid of making any mistakes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A new person entered his life one day .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Michael was nervous when he was asked to do some work together with that new fellow .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The newcomer could only watch it with a shy smile .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Their boss checked the work then .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He wanted to know his partner 's opinion too .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The poor boy said he was inspired by Michael 's enthusiasm .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was perfect and he would be glad just to improve some things , to change the structure , to exclude unnecessary facts , to add some bright illustrations and so on .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The boy had changed everything in the content of the work by the end of their conversation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Feeble souls
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The problem is choosing who to donate to .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I choose none of the above .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I 've never understood why most people see a closed set of charitable organizations to choose from when they want to donate money .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In other words , they choose only from the most common causes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I have one of those unknown diseases , and I could easily donate to the doctors working on my illness , but I probably wo n't . I know that there are a lot of other people with diseases that are way harder than my own , and they need a cure much more than I do .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I 'm grateful I can bear my sickness and live with it , because others ca n't .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S An example of an intervention in airway management is the ventilation mask that Mr. Sharma was using .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Hence , he needs oxygen supply to prevent any airway obstruction .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The reason why walking is the best sport on the face of the Earth
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First of all , let me address the title of this article .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I realise walking is not considered a sport by everyone .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I think it is a wrong way of thinking of sports .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore , I am going to explain the advantages of walking .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This could be seen as something minor , but being able to do the sport you love without paying is an incredible advantage .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Secondly , I love its freedom ; no pun intended .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You can walk whenever and wherever you like .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That is priceless .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Thirdly , walking gives you a longer life expectancy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There are a lot of studies that prove this .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Last but not least , you do not need any kind of special equipment or people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You can go walking alone and without shoes if you please .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Nevertheless , you learn a lot of things about any sport once you start doing it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore , I would like to share some things with you .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You can start walking as you like , despite that , you should wear comfortable clothes and shoes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The reason is that , the longer you walk , the more you will feel what you are wearing .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I hope I have convinced all of you to go walking .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I am a true believer in walking .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When there are students with varied levels in English , it may be challenging for teachers to prepare for or deliver the course .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Here are some of my solutions for this issue .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First of all , determining the needs of the students is always the top priority .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Moreover , instead of using a core textbook , or using different levels of textbooks , carrying out a theme - based approach is more appropriate , and it also saves teachers ' preparation time .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Young people in Ukraine are more comprehensively developed than young people in USSR .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Now youngsters have open access to knowledge and information through the Internet .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The number of Ukrainian students who study abroad increases every year .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The most valuable thing is that there are so many supporters of different trends in all these areas .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Some people prefer one style of music , some - another .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That 's why it 's difficult to define one general style for the generation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Discussing music styles , people in my country prefer pop and rock .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There are a lot of Ukrainian executives .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's all about lines .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The finish line at the end of residency , waiting in line for a chance at the operating table , and then , there 's the most important line .

S Rationale :
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I found that the class challenged the student who had the answers , if they had written down something different .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I found that they challenged each other more than they ever do me .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This method made the class lively and gave the students a chance to really defend their points of view .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They used a lot of language that they would be able to use in everyday discussions ( arguments ) outside of the classroom .

S I had the opportunity to have different language classes , such as English , French and Spanish .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore , the hardest task of learning another language is to keep a high level of motivation to work on it and to pay for it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Thus , I suggest that everyone learn another language , in order to be a citizen , not of a country , but of the world .

S He smiled , knowing that even the best laid plans crumble and was glad that he was taught to plan to police standards .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Peter began his slow dissent into the bowels of the building in front of him .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Graffiti covered the lower portions like a twisted skirt , doors missing , and windows gone .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S His feet crunched on the unknown as he walked through the abandoned hallways .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Peter 's head jerked around as the first signs of his crime came to light .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Now running , Peter soon found himself on the top floor .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S His panting turned into a magnificent grin as he looked out the window and saw a black helicopter heading in his direction .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We need free books for our schools
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is an old petition .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Every year we waste money buying new books for our students .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We also waste paper in those books .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We do not need to go down that road again .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We can avoid repeating the same mistake again and again .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They are obvious , nevertheless , I feel I should repeat them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Each book can be used by more than one person .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore , it is cheaper . We can save money and trees .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The former does not need any explanation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The latter is going to be more important as time passes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I imagine I am not the only one who could donate books .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Last but not least , we could create an association that could be in charge of receiving books at the beginning .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Later , it could support other school initiatives .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was difficult to tell .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They needed someone who looked important or rich .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Someone who knew too much maybe .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S " What about him ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S " She pointed at a man who was making a deal with another man .

S They said in a delightful and evil tone .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They controlled his mind .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The building was luxurious and covered by the most wonderful structures ever .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S What was inside was dangerous but fascinating .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They made a decision and one of the bosses was in front of them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Yes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It offers unlimited entertainment as well as food for thought .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To quote an example , the prime minister of India recently launched a new channel called DD KISAN - the first television channel dedicated to farmers in India .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This would help the farmers to know the latest techniques and trends in agriculture and will also enable them to put across their queries to the concerned specialists in their field .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Let 's take a look at our cartoon channels .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Hence , I conclude that television entertains as well as educates .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , I believe that their functionality will change .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Although there are a lot of things which could be improved , not everything is bad in this movie !

S Dear Katy
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I 'm really glad to hear from you !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Do n't worry , I 'll try to make it easy for you to decide which is the option that suits you best .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the one hand , you 've been doing sport since you were seven years old and I understand it 's very important for you .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , as far as I 'm concerned , it 's not necessary to work out that much to be healthy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As a matter of fact , you just have to eat a balanced diet and do sport twice or three times a week .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That way , you will be able to do sport as well as going to music classes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , you love playing piano and , in my opinion , you wo n't be able to keep it up if you give up music classes , as you do n't have any instruments at home .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Besides , I do n't think your parents would buy you a piano , since it would really annoy your neighbours .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Besides , as I have already said , you can exercise three or four hours a week instead of going every day to your training session .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As I see it , you could n't live without music even if you tried .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Now it 's your time to choose .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I hope my advice makes sense to you and that it helps with your decision .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Best of luck with your dilemma and do n't forget to write and tell me the outcome !

S However , I see sport as a physical activity , where I constantly challenge myself to achieve better results .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's just like a competition when I practise sport .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S My favourite sport is swimming . I can only practise it in my free time , as school keeps me very busy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When I 'm able to , I go swimming twice a week for two hours each .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S At least once a month , usually on Sundays , my friends and I hold a competition .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Swimming gives me a huge amount of satisfaction and so much desire to keep on challenging myself .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Dear Editor ,
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I am writing to inform you that the package holidays to Madrid you are currently advertising in your newspaper are apparently not what they claimed to be .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Nevertheless , there were many inaccuracies in the advertisement and certain aspects of the holiday were chaotic .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The tourist agency made group bookings , which resulted in the unusually low price of the holiday package .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another point of concern was transportation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We had several problems , especially with the bus , which was often delayed and in one case it even caused us to miss a scheduled guided tour .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I believe there is plenty of room for improvement since , although the problems were not insuperable , they caused great inconvenience .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , a better transport agency should be found for the former difficulties to be prevented .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Secondly , advertisements should be clearer as it is very easy for someone to misunderstand them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But the most important issue is the improvement of the general organization .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I assume that the tourist agency can think of better solutions than me , but I hope that my recommendations will be taken seriously .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Best Regards ,
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The last film I saw was called " No Escape " .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is the best movie I have ever seen ! You will be tense while watching the whole movie and I know it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The events are really intense and they just keep getting more and more intense by the minute .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It also shows you the power of the family and how they should stick together through all the difficulties they face .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It also shows how you should always think of others before thinking of yourself .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Some people think that this job should be done by the parents and others think unfairly that this is the teacher 's responsibility .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , they will talk or build a relationship based on what they see their parents doing with other people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But it should not be forgotten , that parents have the most influence as they are models to follow .

S DESCRIPTION
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Furthermore , the organizers had carefully planned the whole course , including meals and beverages too .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S ACHIEVEMENTS
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S FAILURES
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Despite the strengths mentioned above , there were also some areas that required some attention .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To sum up , the course was generally successful , as the positive feedback received suggests .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So , the first two questions are :
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Has my writing improved and how did this happen ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Secondly , has my writing improved and in what way did this happen then ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I discovered that I know many more words than I thought and I can make well - structured sentences now , which I could n't do so well at the beginning of this school year .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This has to do with the technical grammatical features I learned in class as well .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The way I see it is that I learned to use cohesion in a correct way , which makes the paragraphs that I write more clear .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Besides that , I use cohesion which I did n't use before this course .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A few examples are : from my point of view and it seems to me .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Although I believe that I already have improved my English since the beginning of the school year , I 'd like to improve my English vocabulary .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As I see it , the bigger the vocabulary , the better the writing process .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's my belief that the free writing presentations helped me with my writing process .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I agree with the given statement .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A better future means having good food to eat without worrying , good clothes to wear , a big property , a private means of transportation and many more .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S People from other parts of the world are also heading for the same dream .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A single car will not be enough for a family .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It has also become a vital thing for life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We can indulge in many things if we can manage time properly .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So , I believe that there is no future for public transport .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Domestic violence
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They are just the most sensitive and innocent victims of mistreatment .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is so difficult due to the fact that they usually feel stupid , miserable , hopeless and do not feel good about themselves .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Their aggressors make them become insecure and they think that they are alone .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We need to consider both sides of the argument for public transport use prior to reaching a conclusion .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Public transport is used for many reasons and can be convenient for different circumstances .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This form of transport can be used to avoid delays due to traffic conditions and parking restrictions .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It can provide an opportunity for people to complete work during the journey .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Public transport may be the only option for individuals who do not drive or have access to a car .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is more environmentally friendly because it has the potential to reduce the numbers of vehicles on the road .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It may be expensive to use for some individuals and crowded during rush hours .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A car can be useful for effective performance of many tasks .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is easier to change routes when circumstances change unexpectedly .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , a car can be expensive to maintain , park and fuel .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S My favourite film of the last few months is " Scent of a woman " .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One problem is that some scenes are too long , like the one in which they 're having dinner with the colonel 's family .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's certainly a good choice if you want to watch a DVD next Friday night .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The professor , however , disagrees with points made in the article and explains that this system has its own disadvantages .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is not easy to prove that there is a relationship between organizational culture and performance .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For a very long time there has not been scientific evidence that proved the relationship between organizational culture and performance , until studies found a correlation between these subjects .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These four studies are put together in a model named ' Organization Culture Performance Model ' ( OCPM ) .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This model tells us that the culture is determined by actual behavior of individual or groups of employees .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The culture is caused by organizational variables .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The external aspect is : external client orientation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The internal aspects are : design of organization , communication , HRM - orientation and leadership .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There is n't a direct relationship between organizational culture and actual performances , but there is a direct relationship between organizational culture and expected performances .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A short summary of the OCPM- model : there are organizational variables that determine the visible and invisible behavior of employees .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These variables and behavior of employees determine the expected performance and then there is the actual outcome .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Should smoking be banned ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's a real issue for the government to understand that if the process of banning smokers starts , the income rate will immediately decrease .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's important to understand that you are responsible for your surroundings and people around you .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The purpose of this report is to consider how my town takes care of the environment and to explain what kind of recommendations and improvements you can make if you live in Madrid .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's very easy to recycle things and it 's possible to choose alternative energy sources .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , people can take the bus or the underground and leave his or her car at home .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Secondly , it 's quite easy to deposit plastic , paper and glass in different recycling bins .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another option is the possibility of having solar panels on the roofs of some buildings in Madrid .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We could reuse and recycle household waste .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When we go shopping , we should take our own bags instead of using plastic bags from the shop .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Our aim should be to deposit as many things as possible in the plastic , paper and glass bins .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And if you have a garden , you could turn your vegetable peelings into compost .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In conclusion , Madrid offers a lot of alternatives to take care of the environment .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Discuss the risks and impacts of climate(weather)-related natural disasters .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This essay will examine global warming and precipitation shortage as causes of drought , followed by two main negative impacts in terms of the economic and social problems in agriculture .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is obvious that global warming can be attributed to greenhouse gas emissions .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Undoubtedly , all the factors are responsible for the soil water shortage and decreasing precipitation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Additionally , this event is different depending on the areas .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is estimated that 75 million to 250 million people in Africa will be exposed to water stress due to desertification induced by climate change " , states by IPCC ( as cited in Baker , 2012 , p. 20 ) .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As a consequence of both direct and indirect impacts of agriculture , prolonged drought can be commonly defined as the biggest factor .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Thus , we should consider this kind of threat to our future .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I do not blame anyone for this , because I know , this heart of mine seems to just fall in love a little too fast and easily .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Why is that so ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This past few months have made my life unfathomable , making me unable to grasp the idea of when is the right age to fall in love .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S After I have accepted that , I will begin to push all their flaws aside , because their flaws will only make me fall in love with them even more .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I know it is wrong to have strong feelings for someone who is definitely older , and I know nothing will come out of it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To me , love is not about having two parties loving and embracing each other .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It will make you cringe , bawl like baby .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S No matter how wrong I may sound , believe me , it is so true .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Love is not all happy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Michael was terrified .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But the phone was dead .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He wanted to hide somewhere but he could n't think straight .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So he started repeating in his mind " It 's only a dream .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's only a dream .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Suddenly he felt brave and unstoppable .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It ca n't be real .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But the bunny yelled at him to shut the door and bit his arm so badly that tears came out instantly from his eyes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He was now puzzled and frighten too .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is sometimes maintained that when manufacturers and retail companies try to persuade us to buy something , colour is a very effective thing which helps them do that .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , I am convinced that colour is very important when people buy clothes , especially for women .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In addition , companies are used to conducting different surveys to find out which colour is more popular in various social classes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Furthermore , colours which are used in decoration of shops or restaurants are also rather influential .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , psychologists are convinced that red is a colour which stimulates people 's appetite and makes them feel hungry .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Having said this , however , I think that there are many other factors which are even more important than colour for people when they buy something .

S I went downstairs to the playground for the break .

S I was walking alone around the noisy and crowded playground , looking for my very first friend , when I saw a quiet girl under a tree .

S Taking a year off after finishing school can be harmful depending on what you 're planning to do in that year .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Interrupting the momentum by taking a year off is maybe the worst thing you can do .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So , whether you take a year off or not , my point is that you should n't be wasting your time .

S There is no doubt that the subject of keeping animals in zoos creates a lot of debate .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Some people say zoos are traditional family entertainment and good for animals .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Others say keeping animals in zoos is cruel and inhumane .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One advantage of zoos is that they give people the chance to see and learn about animals .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This makes people more likely to want to look after animals and protect their natural habitats .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another positive aspect of zoos is that they help to protect endangered species by offering them a safe place to live .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In addition , zoos help to find mates for endangered species .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , many pandas would not find a mate to breed with if they were on their own in the wild .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , there are many arguments against keeping animals in zoos .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , zoo animals often suffer from stress and boredom when they are not in their natural habitat .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Secondly , unwanted animals are sometimes sold to circuses , hunting parks or for meat .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Consequently , they are mistreated , hit and live in an inadequate place where they can not behave freely .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another drawback is that animals sometimes escape from their enclosures , which is dangerous for humans .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To conclude , there are strong arguments for and against keeping animals in zoos .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Personally , I think it is acceptable to keep animals in zoos , as long as they have enough space and are properly looked after .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is not their fault , of course .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These rules can influence behaviour in a positive way , because they prevent you from doing stupid things .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They have more life experience so they probably know what they are talking about .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Lastly , adults can set an example for younger people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When someone greatly admires a person , they will try to behave like them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , it is n't all that great .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Because young people often do n't like to be belittled .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So setting rules might cause them to do the exact opposite .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Also , advice is n't always taken positively .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The condition starts with pain when you move your shoulder joint and then progresses into total failure and limitation of the shoulder .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Although very important and critical , there are lots of myths surrounding it and many patients suffering the disease do not know the real facts about it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Surgery is our last resort if the condition is severe and all the previous lines of treatment failed .

S 4- If you believe that you can easily prevent frozen shoulder , then of course you are right .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Physical therapy returns your body to its previous healthy condition before trauma .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If not done , healing is not fully completed and the joint remains painful .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore , further avoidance of movement occurs and leads to frozen shoulder .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First of all , we would like to thank you for letting us know about your concerns and giving us the opportunity to explain ourselves .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We already passed your comments about the format on to our chief lawyer and hope he can approve the necessary adjustments .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Be assured that we take your concerns seriously .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We would like to thank you for making us aware of the strong sound of the letter .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Our staff worked hard to relocate our guests as soon as possible in nearby hotels and at our Paraíso Complex , in order for them to continue enjoying their holidays .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You mentioned in your email that you would have travelled again with IBEROSTAR if it was not for the format of the release letter .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Having used public transport for so many years , as I 've lived in a big city since I was just a child , I do n't think public transport will disappear .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In terms of money it is much cheaper to travel by bus than to use your own car .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You do n't need to get angry or mad if you do n't find a parking space , you can just get on / off the bus wherever you like .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You can also enjoy the company of those travellers sharing the same transport .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Sometimes you can even meet new people on the bus .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In contrast , agentic culture stresses the differences between individuals , along with egotism and inequality ( Zarbatany , Conley , & Pepper as cited in Okazaki , & Taylor , 2013 ) .

S Speaking for myself , I think that the pros outweigh the cons .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And furthermore , it 'll be reassuring to get by with your basic necessities in another country .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , studying a new language can be a bit daunting at first and you 'll have to keep on track on a daily basis if you want to improve your language skills .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This will give you an advantage in your future career .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Paparazzi and journalists are following them everywhere they go .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the one hand , many famous people like being discussed all over the world .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But in spite of this , sometimes journalists can be too insistent , trying to get at as much information as possible .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Generally , celebrities deserve to have a private life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Dear Paul ,
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Thanks for your email .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was really awesome !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You know , I have graduated culinary school and it was a great opportunity to use my skills . I 've made a lot of new friends .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We 're still in touch .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The bad thing about it was that it took me a lot of time .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I fell behind , but it was worth it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I 'm sure you 'll find something for you and you 'll enjoy it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So my recommendation to you would be to do something similar if you are looking for good experiences and plenty of laughs !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Let me know how it goes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We are living in a digital age .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The Internet has many good points : it 's an infinite source of information and it 's a cheaper and faster way to communicate with other people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The Internet is also a ' home ' for many social networks .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One of them , the most famous and the most used , is Facebook .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We can use Facebook to get in touch with our friends and even to meet new people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Sounds nice and easy , right ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the one hand , it 's addictive . Internet addiction represents a serious problem in our age .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , lots of people using fake accounts are lurking on Facebook .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This means you do n't know for sure who you 're really talking to .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Stalkers , pedophiles , human traffickers , murderers and other criminals ; these are just a small part of the threats you can come across on Facebook .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In conclusion , I think that we ca n't be safe anywhere anymore - not even online .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The best way to keep ourselves safe is to keep our Facebook profiles private .

S Only a few of them like to wear fashionable clothes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S CONCLUSION
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Some of them are pretty similar to those we had in the past ; others are completely different and very interesting to explore .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This house believes that everyone should be able to speak English .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Imagining everyone had the opportunity to learn and therefore communicate with each other in a worldwide spoken language is certainly an appealing idea and would , without doubt , have many benefits .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , as mentioned before , it would give everyone the opportunity to communicate with everyone .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Nowadays , more and more people are learning how to drive , as driving one 's own car is , as everyone knows , much more convenient than taking public transport .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The future that lies ahead for public transport seems to be a bleak one .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But is it really the case ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Without doubt , having our own car provides us with great convenience .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , we should not overlook the fact that not everyone can afford a car .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Some people may argue that we can buy a second - hand car if we ca n't afford a brand new one .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Not to mention that there are tourists in Hong Kong , who have no choice but to use public transport .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Having scarce land is not the sole problem in Hong Kong .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Hong Kong is also famous for its heavy traffic , which implies the problem of traffic congestion .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S By taking MTR , one can save all the hassles of wasting precious time being stuck in a traffic jam .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Besides saving time , taking public transport can also help reduce the emission of greenhouse gases .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S People are becoming more and more aware of the importance of environmental protection and want to contribute to saving our Earth .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In this regard , they may take public transport instead of driving their own car even if they have one .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Maybe .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Who knows ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Hi Harry
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's good to know that you 'll be in the shop next Saturday while I 'm away in Lugo .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First , you need to know how to open the establishment .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I asked for my right - hand employee David to come earlier due to your arrival .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He 'll be in front of the place at 8.30 , just 15 minutes earlier than we open the doors .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The problem is David 's shift ends at 14:00 , so he wo n't be with you in the evening , when we usually lock up at 20:00 .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S All the best

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Often , dealing with new situations does not help us to feel comfortable .

S Hi George !

S What 's up ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I hope you 're great !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So , let me see .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Your journey lasts about 40 minutes and you have to get off at the station called Brighton and I will be there !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Get it ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Oh , the ticket !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's cheap , is n't it ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Then , yes , the weather .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's going to be sunny and warm dude !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We 're going to have a great time together !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S KIT and let me know about your journey !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S See you soon ,
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Mich
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First of all , it is essential for young people to learn how to take care of themselves , such as knowing how to cook .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Fast food has become part of everyday life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Moreover , it is a welcome distraction from the theoretical school routine .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Some families may be able to afford money and do n't think about its value .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Passing this attitude on to their children , they wo n't be able to save money for emergencies and deal with it reasonably , which is a necessity in order to survive .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The two most useful , in my opinion , are cooking classes and personal finance .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore , Jake tries to arrange his stays with one goal in mind : travelling in a comfortable way but saving as much as possible .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Brussels , Europe 's capital , made his stay very pleasant .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Jake was able to enjoy its multicultural environment and its great cultural initiatives .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He could easily move from place to place at very convenient prices .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A few weeks later , Jake had to travel to the South of Italy to follow the case of immigrants reaching the coasts of Europe via sea from Africa and the Middle - East .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He was so excited about that trip .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Italy is his parents ' country of origin and it was the first time for him to visit Italy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He soon came to realise how disorganised public transport is in the South of Italy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He was surprised by the poor quality of the air when walking around .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The air was polluted by smog due to the huge number of cars .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Jake could only move around by using the few expensive taxis available .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In particular , an efficient public transport impacts on :
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Environment - it reduces cars on the roads , therefore air is less polluted
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Your own and your community 's pockets ! ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Seville is well known for its stunning monuments .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First and foremost , it is difficult to feel deep emotions when it comes to living in a place without real social contact .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore , I miss my close - knit family and friends .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I 'm having a very nice time in Seville though .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In fact , the more I know about its organization and its people , the more I feel at ease in Seville .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is almost as if I were at home now .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To be honest , I was not very attracted by the spirit of the city at the very beginning of my stay .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In my opinion , Seville was rather disorganized and not very charming and its citizens rather rude .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In my view , getting to know a city is quite similar to getting to know people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Of course , it may happen at times that I dislike what I discover !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is partly due to the fact I have picked up a few words which enable me to interact more easily with its citizens .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , people start to talk with me when they notice I make efforts to speak in their language .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There are even some smiles and laughs , which is very reassuring for someone who is alone abroad .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For instance , I spent some time last night eating tapas on a small street in a laid - back atmosphere .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I was surrounded by joyful Spaniards who were speaking loudly .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Needless to say , I greatly enjoyed this time as it made me feel as if I were part of their life and of the place .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On account of all this , it is easy to understand why my perception of Seville has significantly changed over time .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As far as I 'm concerned , the city is no longer a museum displaying sumptuous and ostentatious monuments .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S WHAT AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Have you ever witnessed the collapse of a myth and the birth of a new star at the same time ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Unbelievable as it may seem , this is really a bizarre coincidence .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Dear Jo ,
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's great to get some news from you .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S What a lucky man you are to have a year free !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Switzerland is really a great place for travelling . You should plan two different periods to visit sightseeing places , one in summer and the other one in winter .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Famous sightseeing places are really different during winter and summer .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In any case , do n't hesitate to visit me and my family in Lausanne .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I look forward to seeing you during your trip .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Twenty minutes had passed , but Sarah was still inside the house .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He started to bite his nails , restless .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S What if she was in trouble ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S What if the owner of the house has caught her ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He climbed the tree clumsily and managed to enter through the open window .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was a dark night , so he could barely see .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S -There is no need for you to climb through the window , like a thief - said a soft voice .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The shock made Peter gasp .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Before him there was a tall , dark woman in black .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He had n't seen her when he had gone into the room .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S His eyes were adjusted to the darkness now , so he could recognize her .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S --Tris .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Tris ' smile became bigger .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S -It has been a long time , Peter .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S May I ask you why you are breaking into my house instead of knocking at the door ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S How rude of you !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There was no anger in her voice , but amusement and something else that Peter could not distinguish .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S -Where is Sarah ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She must be here .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Tris 's smile faded away .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S - You are the only person that came here in the last five hours , Peter .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Unless ...
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The silence that followed her words was oppressive .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Please , help me find her .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She could be in danger .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Tris sighed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S --Sorry , my friend , but I 'm not gon na face my husband again .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This time , you are on your own .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Take a look at the highways near the big cities .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They are full of cars each and every day .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If there were a future for public transport , that would n't happen .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Travelling by car gives you independence .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You are not tied to the timetable of the public transport .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You can choose when you would like to go .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You can also choose where you would like to go .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Those are great advantages everyone can see .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Right now we have a problem : the oil reserves are depleting .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That is going to happen sooner rather than later .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The reason is that , once we are free from our oil shackles , we will say farewell to most of its problems .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There will be no more greenhouse gasses , you can forget about escalating gas prices and , finally , you will not remember air pollution .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Last but not least , we are entering a digital era .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Computers and smartphones are becoming more prominent in our lives .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Why would I travel to a meeting in a different city when I can meet through Skype ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I can not find the reason .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's a waste of time and other resources .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We need to embrace the advances of technology and we will be free of those terrible experiences .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I enjoy watching soap operas on TV and the best one for me is EastEnders .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It shows that ethnic minority people can integrate with the majority Caucasian people without losing their cultural and traditional values .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In addition , it provides an opportunity for people from different backgrounds to peep into the culture and traditions of British people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To travel around the world has always been my dream since I was a little boy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , what is the best means of transportation to see the world for yourself ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As far as I am concerned , I would prefer to travel by boat .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A couple of good reasons are behind my choice .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First , to travel by boat is a very relaxing and carefree experience , compared to being confined to a very narrow and limited little space on the seat of a plane .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Third , when it comes to travel , what really matters is not your destination .

S From my perspective , it is the process that is more valuable .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore , I would choose to lengthen the process of travelling , and a comfortable voyage on the sea would certainly become my first choice , since it guarantees a long and pleasant travelling experience .

S I work in Café Noir , a well - known restaurant , popular with visitors in the centre of town .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , I do not understand why this is being implemented so quickly and why there has been no discussion - there is no time for anyone to feel comfortable with the idea .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Secondly , it is unthinkable to suggest it in outdoor bars and restaurants - such an idea is completely unworkable .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was unsuccessful , and the politicians had to reverse their decision .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A non - smoking policy was introduced by some restaurants ; the consequences were terrible : a large number of their customers vanished .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So I switched and I 'm happy to say that it was the right decision !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I am the only grandchild that ca n't speak Korean properly because I grew up in Bavaria and not in NRW , but they taught me to cook .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It started when I was a little child , and it 's what I do .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When I 'm stressed or trying to postpone things like studying or cleaning the flat , I cook .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Sharing my flat with two boys is amusing most of the time , but when it 's about cleaning … oh my !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And we 're a pretty good team because all of my cooking led to many evenings spent together in our kitchen .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is an activity that requires many people , which improves your social skills and your overall ability to manage a group .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It involves many moral virtues , which makes football one of the best activities for teenagers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And if you do decide to take it seriously , this sport will put you through workouts and sustained practices that are going to make you really fit .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Finally , football involves relationships in moments of tension , and this is the natural context for virtues like justice , courage and honesty .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If you want to try it , you should find a club near you .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A Real Vacation and A Dream Vacation
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To me , a vacation is a specific trip or journey for recreation or tourism .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And I usually spend my vacation with my family during school break .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , there are two kinds of vacation , a real vacation and a dream vacation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One summer vacation , I went on a trip to Paris with my family .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was a 10-day trip .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And we had booked all our hotels in advance .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It seemed to be a dream vacation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But it turned out to be totally different when I arrived there .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was in the afternoon when we arrived .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When I walked out the airport , I was attracted by the beautiful scenery .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The streets , the cafés and the people formed a beautiful picture .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S At night , I expected to have a romantic French dinner at a posh restaurant .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But no , instead of sitting in a restaurant , my mum took us to a supermarket to get some sandwiches for dinner .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And we had only water when we were thirsty .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But it made my legs sore every night .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And I would like to go there with my boyfriend .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S After , I would head to the sandy beach and relax in the sun , feeling the breeze .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Lying on the beach is very relaxing and it is the perfect thing to do on vacation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Once the sun goes down , I would hit the bars to have some drinks and enjoy the nightlife .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And I would always have my meals at some luxurious restaurants .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Vacations should be relaxing , not tiring .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And it is all on account of the budgets we have .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S From now on , I will save my money to turn all my vacations into my dream vacations .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Very soon I realized that this job was n't for me .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It took me 12 years to get the courage to quit because it was my family company and I felt really sorry , but I had to grow up and improve my professional skills , so I began to look for a new job .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When I received an email from a company based in the centre of Milan , I was really excited !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I meet lots of people every day and I have the chance to talk to smart people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Everyone lived peacefully and harmoniously until one day , at the welcoming ball in honour of the little princess , a horrendous witch showed up and cursed the little princess named Sophie , who would die at the age of 16 and only a kiss of true love would save her .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As only a gentleman would do , he apologised and introduced himself to the Princess :

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I believe that saying that there is no future for public transport given that travelling by car is so much more convenient , is premature . We need to consider a lot of factors before we can make a judgement of this kind .

S It is only a matter of time before we reach a tipping point with respect to the limited natural resources that we have .

S It gives information about their tastes in music , TV programmes and clothes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Music
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A revival of rock music has been seen in the past 10 - 15 years .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So , naturally , about half of the teenagers and young adults prefer rock and roll , hard rock and progressive rock to other genres .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S About one third of the rest would claim they listen mainly to pop folk , whereas the rest would be interested in R&B , soul and jazz .

S You changed the time of the Japanese lessons from the evening to the afternoon , when I am actually at work .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So if I want to come to the lesson , I have to postpone all my projects to a later time .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S According to the author , people " flinch from consideration of Good Friday " due to three taboos connected with this day : self - sacrifice , suffering and death .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The way self - sacrifice is seen has changed enormously - we no longer want to sacrifice ourselves , because it 's unpopular and it is in contradiction with the idea of consumerism .

S What is more , we are becoming indifferent to other people 's suffering and that 's why we are n't willing to think about it , even on Good Friday .

S When I started aggressive skating , I had to learn how to balance my weight using heavy two - wheel inline skates .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Shopping is very popular among tourists .

S The most well - known shopping centre is called Marina Bay Sands mall , located in the south part of the island .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Icebreakers
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I was surprised when I realized I was talking too much .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Whenever I talk with someone I meet for the first time , I often make us fall into awkward silences .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But with him , I 'm ... I 'm different , I 'm the one who often breaks the ice .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Because I want him to talk .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I try to recall the jokes I 've read in books or on Facebook or blogs and tell him .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I love his laughter , his smile , his chuckle .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , when we sit in silence , I love to stare at him , reading his face .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Is he feeling bored ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Is something on his mind ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I know it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He 's friendly .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He always smiles when he 's talking .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I once told a friend , " You know ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He 's very friendly .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He can make friends easily .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Even if you meet him for the first time , his smile can make you feel comfortable . " My friend replied , " Yes , I may feel comfortable around him .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We may become friends in seconds .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But I doubt I can read his face like you do . "
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I always want to be with him , talking , laughing , smiling or simply sitting in silence reading his face .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But when I 'm with him , they become secondary .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I am happy when I am with him .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I do n't want to do anything else .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Just being with him is enough .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Please , let me follow my heart , at least for the first time in my life .

S Advertising is a form of communication that is used to influence and persuade consumers to buy products , services , ideas .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , art is the expression of human creative skills and imagination , typically in a visual form .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And advertising is a combination of sounds , images and words .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore , advertising successfully combines other types of art to influence the subconscious and human behavior .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is art .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Art is something that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing to people 's eyes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Hoardings and billboards , which are a part of the urban landscape , are art .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Commercial advertising can be traced as far back as Ancient Greece .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There were posters for entertainment , small ads for businesses , merchants used town criers , paying for events .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She was around fifty years old and rather unattractive although smartly dressed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She did n't see Michael coming either because she had just come out of a Starbuck 's coffee shop right at the corner and was putting her purse back into her massive handbag .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Michael then remembered how he had overslept that morning , how he did n't have time to have breakfast , how he did n't have any clean shirt ready and had to wear the new one that he was keeping for a special occasion and he blamed that woman for it all .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And then he rushed away trying not to be late for work .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A couple of hours later , already in his office , he received a call .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The new human resources manager had arrived and wanted to meet every worker in the company personally .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was his turn now .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He jumped off his chair , walked down the corridor and stopped in front of the HR Manager 's office .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He knocked at the door and when he opened it , he saw , sitting there , the same old lady he had cursed a few hours earlier in the street .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S My article is about a class play .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The first thing you need to start with is a deadline to get everything done by .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Students must learn their lines by heart .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You can give them the play with gaps to read through and finally get them to perform a number of times without a script .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These conditions fall into three broad categories : attitudinal , financial and logistical .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S From an attitudinal perspective , people must first be convinced of the benefits of public transportation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S An educational or public relations campaign must be launched to sensitize those who might have disregarded this possibility before .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S People should be familiarized with the environmental , social and personal benefits for present and future generations .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is one step .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S From a financial perspective , public transportation must be a clear and viable benefit to consumers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In other words , it must be more affordable than driving to work every day .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is another critical step .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S From a logistical perspective , public transportation should be convenient for commuters .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S City planners and transport officials must ensure that frequent and reliable public transportation is available for each citizen .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For people to make the habit of travelling by bus or subway , they must know that they will be able to get to various places on time .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Transport vehicles must be well maintained , subway and bus drivers should be customer - oriented and service must be punctual and efficient .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is an additional important step .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In conclusion , through a multi - pronged approach , it is possible to increase the use of public transportation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S City officials and politicians can lead the way by utilizing these forms of transport themselves and bringing about change through personal example .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Then , more citizens will follow suit and we may all hope to live in a cleaner , less polluted environment .

S Imma Díaz .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S My favorite sport is cycling .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I enjoy this sport because it allows you to take care of your health by using almost all your muscles while you can also enjoy the scenery and visit the places you come across .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Like every sport , it is also a good way to meet people and make some new friends .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You can ride at your own pace and go increasingly far .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It makes you see the road and your environment differently .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For instance , you need good brakes , lights , a bell and reflective stripes on your wheels or reflectors .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A lot of people are afraid to ride a bike in cities because they fear the massive presence of cars and think they will be crushed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Let 's get on our bikes and discover new places !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Dear Paul ,
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Unfortunately , I did n't have time to answer .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I was studying a lot and now I 've got some days to rest .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You wrote that you are interested to know something about the concert I helped organize .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was a great experience .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S After the concert we had to clear the concert area as there was a lot of mess around !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On top of that , each of us got two tickets for the next concert of the band .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Take care , hope to hear from you soon
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I was alone in my bedroom and a young good looking woman entered the room .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It looked quite simple , I had no idea who could have sent me that letter .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When the woman left , I opened it eagerly and when I read the first sentence my heart stopped .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It said that I was now one of them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I felt extremely nervous , I was about to commit a crime and my heart was beating uncontrollably , really fast .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S " Hi " , he groaned drumming his fingers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S " Do you have ice - creams ? " I asked nervously .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He was quite small , about seven years old and he was beaming , smiling from ear to ear .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Silence .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S " Hey little boy , what are you doing ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He yelled angrily .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S My heart nearly stopped beating . I turned and noticed that the man was not speaking to me , but to the child .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S " Where has the sweet box gone little thief ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He rasped and crossed his arms .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S " I have not taken anything yet " , the boy whimpered .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Feeling horribly guilty , I fell asleep .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A day at the races .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I think that horse races are a fun entertainment if you like one of these three things : animals , betting and fashion .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But you can also have a " horrible " day at the races : if you 're not savvy enough to know the differences between the bets , you can end up skint , penniless .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That 's the raison d'être of horse racing : lose or win money .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Hello ,

S For today 's teenagers it is hard to imagine life before mobile phones although it did exist only some decades ago .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Few technical inventions have had such a deep impact on our daily life as this little thing .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , there are various advantages and disadvantages to a mobile phone and everyone has to decide for him- or herself in which way to use this medium .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First of all , the mobile phone is a great way to " stay connected " all the time . Chatting with your friends , staying informed of the latest news , ordering online , etc - you can do all these things simultaneously , wherever and whenever you want .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S No need to make a fixed appointment with a friend in advance , as you can always agree to call each other once everyone is on the way .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Last but not least , the mobile phone enables worried parents or suspicious partners to track the child or the loved one nearly permanently .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This can be seen as loving worry about someone but also as a sign of distrust .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Finally , the mobile phone offers both disadvantages and advantages in daily life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I recently saw a film called Passengers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's about 2000 people that want to go to a new planet to start a new life and their trip was going to take approximately 120 years .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But they were wrong .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He was going to be alone for the next 90 years .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He could n't continue like that so he hacked one of the cabins of a woman that he loved .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She discovered that she did n't have any problem with the cabin , it was Mark who hacked it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It does not seem like years have passed since I first met her , but it was some time ago indeed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One day , a girl called Irene talked to me .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She told me that she was bored as well and that she also had two brothers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She was a very friendly person and soon we were chatting every day .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Although we were in the same school , we had n't talked before .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was nearly August when we decided to meet .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I was really excited .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Irene was taller than me , brown - eyed and dark - haired .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And what a beautiful house it was !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She had a swimming pool , a little garden and a lovely bunny called " Suki " .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We stayed there all the afternoon , talking and laughing like we had been friends for ages .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I knew it was the beginning of a great friendship .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That one meeting made it a day I will never forget .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Louis told them that it was related to an instrument to explore new places .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He thought that it was a great way to relax and think about things .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There 's a lot of pressure in the deep parts of the sea and what happened to the rock was the clear proof of it .

S Introduction
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The purpose of this report is to outline actions taken by the authorities of Mińsk Mazowiecki in the sphere of preserving the environment .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The local government of Mińsk Mazowiecki has recently implemented new laws which concern rubbish segregation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is obligatory for the inhabitants to put their different types of garbage into separate bins .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Waste is thrown on the ground and very few people are concerned about this problem .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Town 's actions
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As not all inhabitants are sensitive about the environment , it is the local government 's responsibility to decrease the harmful effects of people 's actions .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There are many workers employed so that the waste is picked up .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One of the most challenging issues in modern cities is transportation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Cities have been planned to satisfy people 's needs to travel all around the city .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Now we can observe people moving around the city using bikes , underground , public transport , and cars .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When referring to cars , we can considerably reduce the number of vehicles on the streets if we use public transport .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , cars require petrol to function .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I was getting really bored .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The floor was very dirty and I could not even go out because all the people who wanted to buy our furniture were standing near our door .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I was so annoyed that I closed my eyes and wished for a chair ...
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It had four red wooden legs and it looked very comfortable indeed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I immediately sat down and began to feel relaxed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Then I realized that the chair had wheels along with a ' nitro & teleport ' button on the armrest .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I might have pressed the nitro button by mistake when I sat down .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I pressed teleport and said , " Botanical garden " .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It actually took me there !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I had a great time taking a stroll there while people watched me with their eyebrows raised .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I wanted to explore more about the chair but I knew that I should go home by them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So I pressed teleport and said , " Home " .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That 's where it took me .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As soon as I reached there the chair disappeared and I landed on the floor with a thump !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S My mother came and said , " Get up !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The floor is so dirty " and she went .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I guess it is back to normal now so I will have to get up again .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I leaned against the wall and thought about my adventure .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Today we had a class discussion about taking one year off between leaving school and starting university .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Different thoughts came up , but my personal opinion is that it could be a wonderful thing .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Personally , I would love to take one year off , and I think I would spend it travelling around Europe .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For this purpose , the presentation will be divided into four sections .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The first section will show the definition of sales promotion as an introduction .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The second part will provide the aim of sales promotion as well as the analysis of some key sales promotion techniques in detail .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Finally , there will be an evaluation of its advantages and disadvantages as well as the present situation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I am enclosing my CV .

S I would be grateful if you could tell me what sports and evening activities I would have to organise .

S In addition , employees do n't get confused by receiving several requests at the same time .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I think the best teacher is a person who has professional knowledge and good teaching skills .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In addition , the best teachers , by their teachings , are the people who we most agree with and appreciate .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Many parents may not satisfy all of these conditions .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First of all , for many parents to have professional knowledge or good teaching skills is very difficult .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Most parents have special skills , but these skills may not be suitable for their children .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Compared with professional teachers , they have specific teaching abilities .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Most parents are not willing to do so because of limited time .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Good teaching skills are based on patience , training and passion .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , not all parents have that kind of personality and most of them are confused or use the wrong ways to teach their children .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Parents undoubtedly play an important role in our life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , we may not be greatly influenced by their teachings , but by others ' teachings .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Although parents teach a lot of things in our life , because they do n't have professional training and we may not agree with them and learn more from them , I think parents are not the best teachers in our life .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I think the most important things in the family are love and support .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The second important thing is that I can always count on my family .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They are always ready to help me , they never let me down .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The third very important thing is trust .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And I like to trust my thoughts and secrets to them , because I know that my family is loyal to me , and their mouths are closed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Nowadays , our environment is really affected by the great deal of progress that technology has made in the last century .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But , is nuclear power good for us ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Let 's begin by considering the arguments in favour .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Huge amounts of energy are generated by nuclear reactors .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Moreover , they only need a small quantity of fuel to be produced .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They wo n't last forever and this will increase the use of nuclear energy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Let 's turn to the arguments against .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S MUx / Px must equal MUy / Py .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Following the tradition of economic reasoning , more is better .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The book says that the rule to follow is to vary consumption until the marginal utility for every dollar for one thing that you are consuming is the same as the marginal utility for every dollar for another thing that you are consuming .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For goods , the marginal utility may start to be less than it was before after a while , and then we are advised to switch our buying to other goods .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Ms. Luhr needs to find the goods which work for her .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Then she would n't be talking about the negative aspects of work because it is work which allows her to consume and maximize her utility .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If Ms. Luhr were truly being selfish and self - interested , she would obtain greater satisfaction from greater consumption , but her statement is defying this tenet of rationality which is so important to economic reasoning .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She does n't want more .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She must be irrational .

S Bodyweight categories are different for women and men .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A lifter who fails to complete at least one successful snatch and one successful clean and jerk also fails to total , and therefore receives an " incomplete " entry for the competition .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Do you suddenly lose confidence when you have to speak to someone ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I had the same problems , but I 've managed to find some ways to overcome them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First of all , adopting a positive attitude is essential .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You should never be afraid of making a mistake or worry that people will laugh at you .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Most people listen for the meaning of what you are trying to say , and do not notice your mistakes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Secondly , you should try to get as much speaking practice as possible .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In class , answer as many questions as possible , and try to participate in class discussions .

S To sum up , because the geniuses that we have decided to recognize as such have been recognized , they argue that all the geniuses are always recognized : pure self - referential nonsense .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is evident that independent speaking and thinking skills are valuable for your career .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For instance , I was really afraid of speaking in front of many people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , this health management and policy class with open discussion was helpful for me insofar as I learned how to speak in front of others .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Everybody was there : the Smiths , with their three broad - shouldered sons ; the Newtons , who even brought some of their stallions to help us remove the earth and the stones ; and the slim guy who lived in the farm in the northern hills of the valley and whose name nobody knew .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Learning another language is a wonderful way of learning about another country .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Check the languages you know and compare them to the people from those countries .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That 's an incredible opportunity .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You need to change the way you organize your thoughts in order to master it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , the new language needs an additional effort .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In summary , learning a language is something beautiful , useful and entertaining .

S Is change always good ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Change is always good .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But sometimes the pace of change , the direction of change or the consequences of change can make it no good at all .

S Everything that does n't grow is dead , and death is the opposite of life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Think of the Olympic Champion Nadia Comaneci , artificially stopped in her physical development to preserve her graceful childish body .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S What is cultural literacy ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I was researching some definitions of cultural literacy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Cultural literacy is the ability to understand and participate fluently in a given culture .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In order to be culturally literate , you need to be familiar with all manner of things , from Waterloo , Hamlet and " Call me Ishmael , " to the Wife of Bath , the Magna Carta , Tutankhamen , the Pythagorean Theorem and 1066 .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A literate reader knows the object - language 's alphabet , grammar , and a sufficient set of vocabulary ; a culturally literate person knows a given culture 's signs and symbols , including its language , particular dialectic , stories , entertainment , idioms , idiosyncrasies , and so on .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The culturally literate person is able to talk to and understand others of that culture with fluency , while the culturally illiterate person fails to understand culturally - conditioned allusions , references to past events , idiomatic expressions , jokes , names , places , etc .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One of the reasons for the worsening of the health of young people is the increasing use of cars .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Nowadays , parents take their children everywhere by car , whereas they would have to go everywhere by bike or by foot twenty years ago .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is a result of the decreasing price of cars due to innovation in the car industry , which enabled more and more people to buy a car ( and use it ) .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The main character is Joe , a looper who has to face an older version of himself sent back in time to be killed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We 've reached a point where this training starts at an early age in the form of extracurricular activities , such as music classes , learning languages and playing sports .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One of the most common examples is Beethoven , known for composing high - quality piano pieces as a young child .

S Many do believe that a talent can be taught , although not so easily .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The main problem of having these two perspectives on talent is that both of them are basically negative .

S Clearly , both rely on the common beliefs to be sustained .

S I live in Italy and you should know that food is very important for us !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Working people usually have lunch at about 13.00 and they have something simple such a pasta or a sandwich and a coffee because the break is short and they have to go back to work and need to be concentrate and do n't get asleep !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S During the day Italian people drink a lot of coffee and everyone has a coffee maker at home !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Young people do not drink coffee : they prefer to drink Coke while eating junk food , which is cheaper and tastier than pastasciutta .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The time for dinner is not the same in all parts .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In northern Italy people eat at about 19 , whereas in southern Italy they eat at about 21 . I get home late and I have no time to cook elaborate meals so I usually cook a steak with vegetables .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Sometimes I give myself a slice of homemade cake .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Italian eat also a lot of fruits like apples , oranges and other fruit of the season .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On Saturdays or Sundays we do n't have to work , so we have time to cook and we prepare typical Italian food with two or more courses .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I really like the lasagna , made with a flat and long pasta with bechamel , tomatoes and meat and I love the pasta Amatriciana made with spaghetti , fresh tomatoes , bacon and a typical Roman cheese called pecorino .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another typical dish from the northern Italy ( it comes from the mountains ) is pizzoccheri which is a wheat pasta topped with cabbages , butter and typical cheese .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I 'm talking about Gorgonzola cheese , which tastes really strong and is n't very nice because it has a blue mould inside .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I remember having tasted the " casu marzu " , a typical Sardinian cheese which has some little worm inside !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , people today know more about space , genetics , and diseases .

S As in all educational processes , assessment of the programme planning must take place .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There are different ideas to be considered as far as assessment is concerned .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In the first place , we have to know why we evaluate .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The teacher will understand the student 's difficulties better ; s / he will know the level of assimilation of the different kinds of contents and be able to modify future programme planning .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Secondly , we must be sure of what to assess and evaluate .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As to the students , we will have to consider the knowledge and skills they have acquired , their attitudes and their social behaviour .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Thirdly , we have to keep in mind the instruments for assessment and evaluation we are going to use .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , it has a special importance nowadays , in a world that moves so quickly .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The first thing that comes to mind on this subject is technology .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It has such a quick growth that it 's impossible to predict how much transformation it will suffer .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I have seen a TV program about homeless people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In the program , one homeless man quit his job because he could not have a good relationship in the office .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Now I will discuss both sides .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the one hand , global warming is a result of many emitted toxic gases .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These are , for example , carbon dioxide and methane .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As we all know , trees store carbon dioxide .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So , we can say , with less deforestation there would be less global warming .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But what are the results of global warming ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The primary outcome is the increasing temperature , and this leads to melting glaciers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These glaciers are habitat for polar bears and many other arctic animals .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The melting glacier will bring a higher sea level .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In Italy , students have to decide between grammar schools and technical institutes as their secondary school type .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Most people think that choosing a grammar school is the best option , because it opens the door to university , while technical institutes are put in a corner .

S In fact , students learn lots of formulas and principles without actually linking them with one another in order to use them in real life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I think that problem should be addressed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Suggestions
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As a child who did not play with " boys ' toys " and identified as gay later , I was often subjected to disdain and hostility from peers and adults .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is a method I use to relax , unwind and revive myself .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Our mind is always full of thoughts .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But all these are addressed through writing .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Writing should be done naturally ; only then it serves its real purpose .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Am I the same person who wrote this ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Let 's see when and how that happens ... !

S It 's very common to hear people talking about friendship , but are we sure about the real meaning of it ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is why the members of my family are my best friends .

S My family loves me whatever I think or whatever I do , no matter if it is correct or not .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They love me just because I am me , for who I am .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The painting is an amazing one and one should definitely take a look at it in order to appreciate its full beauty .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The Mona Lisa is perhaps Leonardo DaVinci 's most famous of paintings .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is an oil painting , painted on poplar wood .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The painting is most famous for the smile of the woman , which people have been trying to decipher for a long time .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The woman is shown with her hands folded , with her breast , neck , and face painted the same color as her hands .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Perhaps the most interesting thing about the painting is the woman 's smile .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Many believe that it is innocent and inviting , while others believe it is that of smugness and is a smirk .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Many scientific studies have been undertaken to determine the exact nature of the smile and the real reason remains a mystery .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is believed that every person sees the smile differently because of the changes in the lighting that Leonardo presented .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The woman is shown seated in an open area , and behind her is a vast landscape , which recedes to an icy mountain .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The painting is an amazing one and one should definitely take a look at it in order to appreciate its full beauty .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The painting is currently on display at the Musee du Louvre , in Paris .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Over the past few years , the Internet has become an important part of our lives .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We use it to communicate with friends , to play games , to watch series , the list is endless .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Unfortunately , it is not perfect .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Because the more people use the Internet , the greater the chances are of people misusing it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Luckily , the government intervenes to preserve the safety of the Internet .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S What it comes down to is , should the Internet be more tightly controlled by governments ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They could get into our computers and steal our information .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They could use that information to get into our bank accounts and steal our money .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This brings me to the next issue .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The reason why the government even take action is to ensure people are able to enjoy the internet , but a more tightly controlled internet would destroy that purpose .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Everybody likes to have the freedom to explore the internet .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So they would not appreciate it if there were suddenly restrictions put on them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To sum things up , the government should not control the internet more tightly .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is fine the way it is right now .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Are people born violent or do they become violent because of how they are brought up ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S How did we become the person we are ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Is there something that makes us unique ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Is it the genes we are born with ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Or are we a product of our own lives ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is clear that genes play a very important part in the person we are .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore , what we need to consider is whether our personality and personal skills are born or made .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Those who hold that nature has a stronger influence than nurture on developing our personal identity will claim that certain personality traits are also determined by our genes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Nevertheless , identical twins that were separated when they were very young and have been raised in different environments show differences in their personalities .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , nature does n't always endow us with inborn abilities .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For instance , parents tend to instil their own passions in their children and , consequently , they will likely be interested in the same academic or artistic field .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As I see it , personal identity is the result of the interaction of our genetic structure and the environment which surrounds us .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Dear Ira !

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I hope you do n't mind if I ask you some questions .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The idea of painting it white seems too boring to me and I 'm completely out of my depth with all this new stuff for ceilings in shops , but I 'm sure you 're an expert !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The floor is also a problem .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There are so many advantages .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is the fastest and the most comfortable one .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Of course , for these facilities you have to pay a lot of money and that could be a problem for some people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The next one is boat .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It could also be really comfortable but we do n't use it often .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's more for exotic trips .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But there is also an inconvenience - it is also expensive .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And it is hard to plan a trip like this .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S James Dashner 's The Maze Runner , joins The Hunger Games and Divergent as the latest futuristic Young Adult thriller to get its own film franchise .

S Is it really possible to describe a man at all ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Would I be able to overcome my own phobias and be fair ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And what about those open - hearted quotes , love songs and poetic opinions he shares on his wall ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Is he a romantic and a killer in one ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He always writes gentle words , uses cute smileys , Facebook kisses and hugs , but when I ask him in what way he loves me , he answers " as a Christian " .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Well , it 's all right .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I 'm relieved .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , the woman inside of me shouts : What ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He does not love me as a woman !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If I want to sleep , he stops his own imagination to let me relax and rest .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I must be honest for a while .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I have always wanted to fly , to travel , to paint , to write and to love .

S I mean what if he tames me like a fox ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He is a hunter .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S No matter what you write , he follows his own lust .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , he is disciplined , because he is able to stop with his imagery at once .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He is cute , anyway .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He just kept quiet and begged me to stop .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I pondered this many times .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But I do like him and I loved the course .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It surely taught me a lot and enriched my whole life .

S Thank you , Kyle .

S In the end , I would like to add a quotation by Franz Marc .

S Purpose
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Recycling
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore , in the last few years there has been a great improvement in raising awareness and commitment among an increasingly larger sector of the population as far as the selective collection of household refuse is concerned .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is clearly illustrated by the growing number of recycling facilities the residents of our town have at their disposal .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Public Transport
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Conclusion
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Red fire ants originated in Brazil .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Fire ants are very aggressive .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They often swarm on their prey swiftly and sting repeatedly to paralyze it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The sting could be fatal if we have an allergy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In the US , millions of people are stung annually and some have died from their injuries .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Fire ants threaten more than human health .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We should use pesticide treatments to reduce their numbers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Nowadays we ca n't predict the aim of future devices though I guess that they will be mainly related to eradicating current illnesses .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Cancer , for instance , is surely one of the preferences for the companies that invest large amounts of money in R&D.
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Personally , I consider curing cancer the most challenging goal for the next generation of researchers and inventors .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Although I advocate new remedies for cancer , I think that there is another problem in the world that society should focus on .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is usually forgotten because it barely affects our daily routine .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , when we talk about hunger we must regard it as the main problem of the world .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That is the reason why I have been thinking for a long time about a new device to eradicate starvation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is not completely developed but I can advance some ideas about its design .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It consists of a pill where we blend lots of different elements .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Manufacturing costs are not expensive and these pills do not expire .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They can be conserved for a long time and shipping costs are very low .

S Football , to me , is more than just a game .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I have learned a lot of things from it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Football requires tremendous amounts of teamwork and sportsmanship to be successful .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We worked all summer in the weight room and ran on the track to get in physical and mental shape before the season .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S At the beginning , I was immature and only thought of myself , sometimes even giving up when I was tired or hurting .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Imagine working all summer and then only being able to play three games !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I needed surgery on my arm and at least five months to recover .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Being with all my friends , even sweating and bleeding with them , really made us bond as a group of hard - working young men I know will succeed in life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S High - school football is more than just a sport .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One thing my coach always says is , "
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Imagine that you have just run 100 sprints and a giant bear starts chasing you .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Are you just going to stand there and let it attack you because you are too tired ? "
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This to me means that you can always control your attitude and effort .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So , no matter what , if you maintain a great attitude and always give whatever you 're doing your best effort , you will have no regrets .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I would like to suggest improving the website in the following ways .

S First , it is difficult to navigate the current website version . We could move the search bar closer to the top in order to make it easier to find .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Besides , adding a schedule to the left section would be an advantage , as our customers would be able to find the option they need in a more convenient way .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Minimalistic design is both stylish and user - friendly , as it does not imply any elements requiring website visitors to load heavy modules , and there are no unnecessary banners that distract the user .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Third , implementing several advanced solutions , such as a calculator , a gallery and live chat , could make our page more useful .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Before focusing on the topic of technology itself , I would like to mention some aspects related to education .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First of all , Spanish educational laws are in Europe , and probably in the world , the only ones which have changed the most in the last 30 years .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This fact leads the teachers to be unsure of what they are doing .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Besides , there are no results that can be analysed or checked .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S While public ones must obey governmental laws strictly , private schools have some privileges .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Knowing this about the Spanish education system , we can now talk about technology .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Teachers must learn how to use these new technological devices in order to get their students motivated .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Thus , this would help students know how the world has evolved and how it will be .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To the Mayor
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I fear that such a huge move would damage businesses and many workers would lose their jobs .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To support my argument , I would like to tell you what happened in my country when such a ban was introduced .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First , it was almost impossible to enforce it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In the end , the government changed the law , encouraging people to provide non - smoking areas .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This approach strikes me as much more realistic and I urge you to reconsider it before it is too late .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This directly affects the producing stage , allowing more efficient production .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Higher purchasing power means that we can buy more goods using the same amount of money .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But why would the goods be cheaper ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S With competition giving him no choice at all , the producer is forced to abide by the market equilibrium .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I never realized that a furkid would enrich my life until I met Casino , a smart , patient and handsome Golden Retriever raised by my wife 's family .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Four days later , he suddenly passed away , and the day became our last memory together .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S His body was cremated and buried on a mountain in northern Taiwan .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A sweet olive tree was planted with his ashes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We visited him several times over the years , and decided to take the sweet olive tree home with us this year .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I miss Casino so much .

S I am hardworking as well .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But this time was special .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The restaurant is in Alcorcon . I have to say that it is a beautiful place , with a lot of beautiful lamps and a lot of space .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's really worth it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S After a Year …
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S My first paragraph aptly expresses my exact realization .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Yes , Gala National High School has given me thousands of reasons to be happy and to feel blessed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The school as a whole has become my great mentor .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Gala has paved the way for me to become that teacher I long to see .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That is us - the teachers of Gala .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And that 's one thing I love the most .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S My personal relationship with my co - teachers is the same as that of a typical Filipino family .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I may have hurt some of my colleagues in a certain circumstance , and they may have hurt me too , but at the end of the day , it 's always camaraderie among us that dominates .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As to my students , I feel really so fulfilled .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Their needs speak beyond intellectual hunger .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Consequently , I have seen the need to attend to their needs .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S My everyday interaction with my students has been my everyday fulfillment .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Eventually , the huge challenge I have had has turned into my inspiration to do better in my job .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There were times I wanted to back off from the many demands of work , but I always found myself fighting .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Dear Mrs Kate Ashby ,
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I am the right person to do the job as I have always been interested in different kinds of food .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I am really interested in applying for this job because I am an outgoing person and I am good at dealing with people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In addition to this , I have broad experience in this field since I worked as a waitress during my last summer holiday .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Marina
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S What I can say is that I have been learning English since I was twelve , and it has been a pleasure from the start .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S My first memory related to the English language is of lyrics ; I love pop music and used to translate songs composed by Elton John and Lennon and McCartney .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I am also an attentive listener of BBC Radio Four .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S What do people think about teenagers ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Why rather negative ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I strongly disagree that they are not experienced .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The young person has to be strong , try to understand the situation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Those examples show that teenagers have to cope with lots of problems .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Most of them are able to .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Of course it 's only my opinion .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Ways to collect and record information for future generations
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Finding the best way to collect and store information for the future is not just a problem in our working life but also in our private life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That is the reason why our class attended a panel discussion on this specific topic .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Different ways of accumulating and storing information were presented at the discussion .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I would like to emphasise two options in this essay .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One way to get the information needed is to interview people from the neighbourhood and either write down what is being said or record it as an audio - file .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , sometimes the narrator tends to fill in the gaps of his / her memory with imaginary parts or tries to embellish certain parts of the story .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another interesting way to find out more about the past is to collect old photographs .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The dinner was delicious and we tasted lots of new flavours of Balinese food .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S After dinner , we saw an interesting show of Balinese dance and music .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was very big ... We could n't believe what we were seeing .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was a very big and beautiful turtle !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But ...
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We shouted and two waiters of the hotel came quickly .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In terms of holidays , some people like to visit their own countries , while others prefer going abroad .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I think going abroad is much more exciting .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S First of all , you do n't have to take very long trips .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Also , you can have the opportunity to discover new places just next to your home .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Besides , this type of vacation is usually less expensive than going abroad .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , many people prefer visiting other countries .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Actually , they like the idea of visiting an unknown land , where everything is different , from the weather to the habits .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Furthermore , they also like going abroad to visit important and famous cities around the world , like Paris , Madrid , New York .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In my opinion , traveling to a foreign country makes people open their minds to other cultures .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In fact , going abroad is a nice way to make new friends , try new things and improve a foreign language .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was three in the morning when the phone rang .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I was just about to go to bed when I suddenly heard the phone and I got scared because I was alone at home , and I thought that it could be serious news .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They did n't have mobile phones because it happened a long time ago .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The film I 'd like to talk about is " Secret Life of Walter Mitty " .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I would like to talk to you about a musical which I saw recently .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is called " Les Miserables " and has much to recommend it , including the plot , the cast and , of course , the soundtrack .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Just after the French Revolution .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is an adaptation from the original book " Les Miserables " by Victor Hugo .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Regarding the soundtrack , I can only say that since I saw the film I can not help singing every song all the time .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Travelling by car is becoming more convenient .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Together with that , more people are getting familiar with driving and feeling more confident about driving their own car .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Once you know for yourself how comfortable it is to have a car , there 's very little chance you will go back to public transport .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I mean the underground in the first place .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is very economical in terms of time , distance and people capacity .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As for buses , they might be history in decades to come .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The show was based on the journey of a married couple , living in India , who get separated due to some misunderstandings .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The rest of the show is based on the interactions between all 4 children and how they work together to unite their family .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's a typical Indian soap opera in which love conquers over everything .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , the attitude that I have is not very appropriate for entrepreneurship .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S PLANE , TRAIN OR BOAT ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Everyone likes something more or less , even when it comes to little things .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is certain that each of us loves to travel , but everyone likes the most comfortable means of transport .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For me , the best way to travel is train , because I think this mode of transportation has the most pros .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One of the things that is very important to me is the price .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another very important thing is the travel time .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In the case of a ship , travel time is immense .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Most of the homes have walls , doors , windows and are built on solid ground .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Furthermore , they have flat or sloping roofs , one or more floors .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Some are situated in the neighbourhood of parks , forests or lakes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They often do not use the popular brick but glass , wood , plastic .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S DEVELOPMENTS IN THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN SPAIN
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S All these changes make the learning process much more fun , creative and practical for the students .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This conflict was an incentive for clothing stores to sell new and weird things for a higher price .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The Japanese government made a competition to see which of their citizens was the best trend - setter .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The winner 's reward was the ability to rule over Japan for a day .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S After two years , the winner was decided , and he made Japan go into poverty .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The winner had changed Japan 's landscape , what once was the amazing city of Tokyo now was a sad and dirty city .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Japan lost a lot , but it was able to get back up on its feet .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Everyone was happy for some time and true peace between the countries of the world had been achieved , but then the United States enslaved Canada and tried to enslave Japan as well , but they were able to defend themselves .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We will discover the importance of a unique fragrance and how to mix the ingredients in the right proportions .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This idea will create the atmosphere to tell us a story about crime and passion .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Few other modern movies are so great in comparison .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The two hours that you will spend watching the movie will become unique in your life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Additionally , if we are eager to travel outside the town in order to have some rest from a hectic rhythm of life , it will be more comfortable for us to use our cars .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Car accidents are the typical reason for this phenomenon .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This makes travelling by public transport much safer .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In conclusion , I believe that public transport will eventually lose its dominance due to the fact that all people want to be independent and travel on their own .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I started playing at the age of seven , when my mother encouraged me to join a basketball club .

S It was very enjoyable from the onset , and has been a fantastic experience to learn the sport together with other children .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another key factor was the coach , who knew how to convey the skills and techniques to children .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Moreover , I was fascinated by the feeling of belonging to a team in which each member shares the same goals and values .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is an important feature that will also help anyone in all spheres of life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When choosing a club , I believe it 's important that an experienced coach is present who knows how to teach the basics .

S However , a major drawback would be the lack of exposure to the language that is intended to be learnt .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , the most important advantage of studying abroad would be precisely , the exposure , which would help you understand the language from native speakers ' point of view and be aware of how some expressions or words are actually used .

S Trains are also boring , unless you take a bullet train , and I get motion sickness .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore , when it comes to speed and being able to go places , planes are definitely the best type of transportation available .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I highly recommend a plane trip as soon as possible .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Nonetheless , the value of time is as important as money .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The main reason for this is the fact that free time could be spent in a more sophisticated way .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The public transport system is overburdened today .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Also , the increase in disposable income has given more buying power to consumers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Public transport can not rival the sheer mobility that cars offer to their owners .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Dear Sir ,

S My name is Natalia Maciejewska Quiñónez and I am a citizen of Castellón .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I am writing this letter to inform you about a serious problem that we are having in the city .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Recently , things have been disappearing from our homes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We have called the police , but they ignore us .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The first few days , they patrolled the city and helped us .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , now it seems that they do not care what happens .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The police should help and make sure that we are safe , right ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I would like the local town council to help us find out what is happening .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S People are afraid and we need help urgently .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Thank you ,

S Natalia
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S My parents always supported me , they always believed that I could do this .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I trained weeks for this , I took extra singing and acting classes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I did n't speak for days to spare my voice .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S My friends and family were there to support me .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Suddenly the curtains opened , the show started !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is also important , though , not to underestimate all the educational possibilities that it gives you , as sometimes you can learn more from a documentary than from a school book .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S What emerged from the discussion we had in class , is that plenty of students spend their free time watching useless reality or TV shows , procrastinating instead of studying for school .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , it is difficult to focus and pay attention while you are in front of a TV screen .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Getting distracted is extremely likely , therefore people watching educational programs may end up switching the TV off or turning over to another channel , as a good movie or any other entertainment is way more appealing .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Dear Mr. Leader ,
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I 'm glad I met you and your group of overseas students .

S Line of Duty is a British police drama , created by Jed Mercurio , about the investigations of AC-12 , a controversial Police Anti - Corruption Unit .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Something was wrong !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She was sure about that .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But not any more .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He was absent - minded all the time , he did not listen to her and when she asked him a question , he just shrugged his shoulders or wrinkled his nose .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Maybe they could not avoid the seven - year itch .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Maybe he had a mistress .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They met each other nine years ago .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She always planned her steps carefully .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Her mother was a shy woman who did not know what to do to escape from poverty and even though she had two or three jobs all the time , they did not know if they would have somewhere to sleep the next night .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So he was her escape .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He was well - off and funny .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Who would want to lose this kind of lifestyle ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So she decided to ask him straight away .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He had not seen that coming and became white as a sheet , raised his eyebrows and just exploded .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So she tried to calm him down .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was her turn to hold her breath .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She was just numb .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He was strong as an ox , for sure , but working as a porter ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He was waiting for her response .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was a cold winter afternoon in England when Michael was born .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Michael had always felt alone and he was fed up with that situation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Michael 's new life was working out for the best but it is very difficult for anyone to escape from his past .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Although his life was perfect , he began to feel sick and sad and he remembered his past life when he was a child .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The attack lasted two endless minutes which were full of suffering , blood and pain .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the one hand , public transport is slow and uncomfortable .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Pickpockets are frequent and you might end up being robbed , losing your money , credit cards and personal ID card as well .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Furthermore , you can choose an alternative road , rather than taking a main road .

S What are the values of young people nowadays ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To answer this question , the first thing to consider is if young people really have sincere values , or on the contrary , if they are only simple copies of a current model of a fake society which imposes unattainable stereotypes on them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Nowadays there are many teenagers who lack their own identity .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They spend all their time thinking only about money , social networks or fashion .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Nevertheless , far from arrogance and vanity , we can still find some young people who have interesting personal values that are used by them to define their lifestyle .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Some values such as solidarity and empathy , that were believed lost , can appear surprisingly in the personality traits of many young people today .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In addition , these personal values joined others such as courage , curiosity , imagination and the sense of adventure , are important aspects to consider and they can become very effective weapons to change the world if they are used suitably .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Friendship was nurtured and we took time to do activities with friends and best friends were limited to one or two of the closest associates .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Today a minute incident can just tear apart a friendship .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We made the extra effort to be friends in the past and it generally worked both ways .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I 'm 24 years old , so I belong to the previous generation , when family , school and life in general worked in a different way , from my point of view .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I have a wonderful family , made up of my father , my mother and my two siblings ( a sister and a brother ) , both older than me .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I consider myself lucky because I know I can always count on them , and because they love me as much as I love them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Parents must be parents , and friends must be friends .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , walking distances in the hotel are way too far for families with young children .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You find yourself walking five hundred meters to the swimming pool .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That does n't seem too far , but when you have small children , you could be walking this twelve times a day .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A quick trip to the toilet changes into a 1 kilometer hike , which is not pleasant when you have small children .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In conclusion , the Miracle Resort is a very beautiful and appealing place to go .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There are plenty of things to do , and the ambiance in the hotel is relaxed , so you can really enjoy your holiday .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So a lot of them go abroad in order to find a good job in better conditions .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Unfortunately , my girlfriend and I need to do it too .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I have finished my degree and my girlfriend is just about to do it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As I said before , the main objective is finding a job there , gaining some experience and improving our English level .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If everything goes as expected and we both find a job , we will visit the city of London .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Laura is the new girl in town .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They all grew up together and have been friends since their childhood .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But one day she collided with this boy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S His name was Michael .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But Michael was keen on getting rid of her .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He opened the door to his home , took a deep breath and turned around .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Good !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We do n't want your attention !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S " Sense8 " is a new kind of television series that has grasped the attention of millions of viewers from the first episode .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The first difference when compared to ordinary TV Shows is that all episodes from Season One were released at the same time .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This seems like a small thing but it represents a major change in the way people view TV shows .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S By releasing all episodes at once , each user can watch each chapter at their own rate and speed , devouring them all in an afternoon or only one per week .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In order to make the series more interesting , the directors decided that each of the eight chosen ones would be in a different country .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The series provides an amazing window into eight different , and extraordinary worlds , with beautiful landscapes .

S Why is it that whenever Ina Garten , Ana Olson or Nigella Dawson is on , I tend to stop everything that I 'm doing and just get fixated on the TV ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To make one , just whisk some eggs and sugar , add some milk and a few drops of vanilla and then pour onto a greased cake pan and bake .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S After a couple of minutes , take the cake out of the oven and let it cool down .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S His mind then thought of their last kiss .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Man , when was that ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It had to be about a fortnight ago , before he went to Sochi for a business meeting .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was merely a goodbye kiss , a quick brush of lips before he had to rush to the airport .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was the unofficial end of the relationship , the decision before the actual talk .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Just to make everything worse , on his way to the office , he slipped on the snow and fell on his back .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Peter got there and had to take practically all of his clothes off because the office was like an oven .

S I am writing in reply to the article about the usage of mobile phones at high school which was published in your newspaper on Monday 12th of September .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I would totally agree with the idea that children should not use mobile phones during class , but during breaks .

S Of course , we all have the right to communicate whenever we want but , mostly , whenever we need .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Of course , when we are talking about children and education , it may seem a bit complicated since this subject has both advantages and disadvantages .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For instance , it is really motivating for students to use technology in the classrooms .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As I said , it is really important that parents can communicate with their children because they are taking care of them and they are their parents , so they have the right to communicate with them whenever they need .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S All in all , I think that schools should not stop taking into account this important subject .

S Furthermore , they concoct stories and concepts , publicise them while making animated versions all over the internet .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The brilliance of their presentations is so acute that an ordinary man is almost forced to feel enlightened in his ignorance , finally becoming brainwashed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The same technique is used by politicians , iconoclasts and leaders who pollute the minds of the people through the medium of technology .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There are several reasons why I support this choice .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They can communicate well and are aware of dangerous situations .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , if they see drunk or dirty people on public buses , they could avoid sitting near them or report them to the bus driver .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Second , it is a good opportunity to educate them in life skills such as knowing not to sit in priority seats or leave litter on the bus .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In contrast , I think that the parents who insist their children should only travel on school buses protect them too much .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In daily life , many youngsters need to go to school and back by public transportation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In conclusion , it is not only a good chance to take the children on an adventure , but also help them become independent young adults .

S Daniel Wan
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Many people have the impression that learning a language is only possible through hard work : studying grammar rules , learning vocabulary by heart and burying your head in a book .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , there are in fact several methods that you can employ should you want to become a linguist .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In this essay I will discuss two of these : the immersion method , and the classroom method .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , the immersion method takes its inspiration from the way in which we all learnt to speak our nature tongue : implicitly .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S With this method , learners are simply exposed to the target language , either by going abroad to live in the country where it is spoken , or by having a native teacher .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There is no explicit focus on grammar ; instead , the learners are expected to " absorb " the language and its rules .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This method has its advantages , as it is the way we all learnt to speak , and so it is arguably more natural .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another advantage is that students are unencumbered by overcomplicated , confusing metalanguage .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Secondly , the classroom method is the one with which most students ( especially if they are older ) are familiar .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Learners are normally taught in their mother tongue , and are given grammar rules , which they then apply to the language they are learning .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This method also has its benefits , not least logistically speaking , since many students do n't have access to native speakers or are not able to travel abroad .

S On the one hand , many argue that younger people should be made ineligible for important government positions , and the implications of this opinion are clear .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Were younger people allowed to fast track their ascension within a country 's military , they could find themselves having to make critical choices based more on theoretical study than practical experience , and this could have catastrophic results .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For one , younger workers bring creativity and fresh ideas to government .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , young government workers in Canada successfully pushed to increase HIV understanding and dispel stigmas attached to the disease in the 1980s , a development that encouraged tolerance and reduced irrational fear .

S Is science evil ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S People 's opinions on this question differ widely .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I think that science has altered our lives in a positive way .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Here are some facts to support my view .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S People today are interested in learning about the surrounding world , about new civilizations and distant planets .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Science explains to us a lot of the things that we previously were not aware of .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It also gives us clues that there may be life on other planets and we might not be the most superior beings in the world .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S With its help , for example , people are able to cope with natural disasters .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We know how to destroy hail clouds which can cause great damage to our crops .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We are also able to protect ourselves from various diseases and help the sick .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , the greatness of science goes together with its disadvantages .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , we are obliged to agree that science has given no answer to man 's doubts .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This means we will lose a part of our national history .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S While the fact that those buildings are not seen as worthy of preservation is an important factor , demolition is more frequently caused by a lack of public funds .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , even with these arguments , demolition is more frequently affected by a lack of public funds because it covers the part about the hindsight of an appropriate budget for eventually renovating as well .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S With no appropriate budget it is unreasonable to keep old buildings which are useless when they are not renovated .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Fame and the attitude to fame have been one of the most thought - provoking topics .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Students usually find it very inspiring and engaging to discuss this issue because it is very difficult to give a clear - cut answer and so , it makes the process of discussion very exciting .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There may be a significant number of arguments which support the statement that fame is a good thing .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S My personal attitude to fame is rather ambivalent .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the one hand , I personally think that the desire to become famous is a great driving force that stimulates people and brings a lot of benefits to others in its wake .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Sportsmen are one of the most vivid examples of it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They can fight against the odds to be in the top league .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is remarkable how much stamina and spirit can be demonstrated by such sportsmen .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Their desire to be at the top contributes a lot to the fame and reputation of their clubs and countries as well .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S What is equally important and adds to the importance of fame is that somebody 's desire to be famous can have a triggering effect on others .

S Wonderful inventions such as the train , bus and airplane have allowed us the freedom to travel and explore this great planet for a lower price .
