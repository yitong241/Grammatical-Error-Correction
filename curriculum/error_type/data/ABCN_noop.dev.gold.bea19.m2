S These first two chapters extracted from Great Expectations by Charles Dickens introduce a young boy known as Pip .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He does not use complex words when he talks , but he uses them when he narrates .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S At least , I feel sorry for him and I would like to find that his story has a good ending .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He looks like a good boy that lives in hell and the Devil is his sister .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Actually , the narrator is our protagonist , but telling the story as an adult .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And the author does not try to describe the protagonist with words , but with actions .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The narrator did not use any description of the protagonist apart from his name .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Apart from this , he just writes exactly what the characters said .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The voice is in first person and uses a subjective point of view .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He only knows what he sees and he thinks about it , but he does not have any omniscient power .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Also , the way the characters talk is opposed to the way the narrator writes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For instance , here is an extract of the narrator at the beginning of the second chapter :
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S " My sister , Mrs. Joe Gargery , was more than twenty years older than I , and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up " by hand . "
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant , and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me , I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand . "
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , the dialogues are simple and shorter :
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S " Now lookee here , " he said , " the question being whether you 're to be let to live . You know
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S what a file is ? "
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S " Yes , sir . "
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S " And you know what wittles is ? "
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S " Yes , sir . "
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Moreover , the vocabulary used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters said .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Regardless , the dialogues are written exactly as they were said .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The thief said " Who d'ye with ? "
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is written as it is said , making it more realistic .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Notwithstanding , the way this novel is narrated is the protagonist .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The story is narrated as it happens .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The second chapter makes reference to the first and reveals something about the thief .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Also , the slow rhythm is adequate .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Therefore , I do not know how the story will end .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Too much mystery and just a few facts can be read in these chapters .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S All I know is that this story will not have a happy ending .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Like another brick in the wall , another tombstone in the graveyard .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If the story has a happy ending , then the central theme could be getting over adversities ; if not , it is a sad story .

S It was the day when she was going to meet her biological mother .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Even though it was illegal , the lady gave her the name and the contact phone number of Sara Fielding , her biological mother .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A month passed by before she had the courage to dial that number .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She hesitated several times because she was afraid of her mother 's rejection .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S After a few seconds , a woman picked up the phone .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But then she said " hello , my name is Anna and I think you are my mother " .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S After another few seconds of silence , Anna heard her mother crying and asking lots of questions .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They agreed to meet the next day in the park .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She was going to have so many answers to so many questions .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The most exciting day of my life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I love him and my dream was to meet him , but I knew it was impossible and my parents did n't want to drive me to his hotel , so I was quite sad .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So I went toward the crowd and when he saw me he smiled .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When he left I was sad but also really happy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This was certainly the most exciting day of my life .

S The best places for young people in Dublin
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This report looks at the best places to visit in Dublin for young people from a different country .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is based on a survey of the young people from Whitehall College as well as my own opinion as a permanent resident in the area .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It seems that the majority of those surveyed are of the opinion that the best place to visit for young people would be Temple Bar .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It offers a wide variety of activities like museums , a cinema , a very large green garden and many pubs to choose from .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The Johnnie Fox Pub was highly recommended , it offers an opportunity to listen to traditional music , watch dancers perform and enjoy a nice meal in one place .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is true that people everywhere like watching sports .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S From one point of view , top athletes are good models to emulate for several reasons .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , watching the success of such athletes , teenagers start to desire to be like their idols and to follow professional sports .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This means they will want to play sports , which is essential for their health .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Secondly , doing sports also teaches priceless life lessons , such as discipline and dealing with success and failure .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is a good example for youngsters to follow .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , sport has become business .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Many sports stars are only concerned about money and fame .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This can lead adolescents to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play well and having the fun of the game or the competition .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Secondly , there are those athletes who behave disgustingly .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , some take drugs or cheat in order to win at any cost .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In conclusion , there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in regard to professional sportsmen as good role models for young people .

S It is a good idea to take a year off between leaving school and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , you can travel to new places .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another idea is you can work , you can find a job and earn money before you start university .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Moreover , sometimes people are tired when they finish school because of the exams so they need to have some time to relax .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S You can find work as a waiter or in a shop .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He got promoted very quickly because he always brought forth new ideas and facilitated the reform and development in the department .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Dear Sir or Madam
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I write in connection with your advertisement regarding jobs at summer camps all over the USA .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Since my mother tongue is English , albeit of the British variety , and I am generally deemed cheerful , energetic and hard working , I believe I am a suitable candidate for the aforementioned position .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Moreover , when an undergraduate , I spent my summers working in the college canteen as a kitchen help , and progressed to the position of cook .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Because of all the above points , I think I am a suitable person for the job .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Yours faithfully
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I find it quite difficult to find an area of improvement given Andres 's outstanding overall performance .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Last but not least , I would test ideas and approaches on customers and staff to make sure that my marketing plan succeeded .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And you ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I challenge you to think about it and try it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Santorini also has a volcano which is a spectacular sight , even though exploring it can be dangerous !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another place worth visiting in Greece is Athens .

S It 's quite important to be organized to get the highest score you can get in your exam .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S For example , one year ago , I had my final surgery exam .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I had set up a plan to study all the books we had to go through for the exam plus reviewing them twice .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If I had n't had such an organized plan , I would never have got such a perfect score .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's quite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed and nervous when exams are approaching .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Moreover , if I aim at getting high scores , I assert that memorizing the details is important .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That will help you a lot even if you do n't get the chance to revise everything before your exam .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In my opinion , nuclear energy has the best chance to replace fossil fuels .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , nuclear energy is n't bad for the environment .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , the technology is evolving and nuclear power plants are getting safer .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Thirdly , only the construction of a nuclear power plant is expensive .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Hi Jane ,
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Below you can find a few suggestions of mine .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , the rate of interest is by 3.1% , which is quite good .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And you do not need to pay any annual charges for having a credit card .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Unfortunately , the bank does n't have branches in Britain .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And all banking operations must be done by phone .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But there is a service charge for owning a credit card ( £ 12 per year ) .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S My parents would take me to a gentle slope with my brother and leave us there for a couple of hours to try skiing on our own .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The temperature was often several degrees below zero , and you would freeze if you did n't keep moving up and down the slope .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S My brother showed a natural talent for the sport , but I felt quite uncomfortable and scared .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Skiing is a great sport , but I would recommend starting as a child , taking a few lessons with an experienced instructor and using the right equipment .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I am extremely interested in gaining experience in the business field .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , they are not always satisfied or taken into the society .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The best example is an animal with great qualities , a dog .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Always friendly , bubbly and in a good mood , they are great to spend time with .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In conclusion , dogs make really great pets .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Not only do they protect you from anything that could do you any harm , but their amazing personality and the love they show to you makes you feel so warm and wonderful on the inside .

S Although homeschooling may seem , according to some of these parents ' opinions , " a paved road " , it
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Educational and emotional freedom support this alternative way of learning .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , homeschooling will never succeed if parents do not have the right skills .

S Travelling helps you to develop as a person in many ways .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When all was set , they started their trip to the forest .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When they arrived there , they started to look around trying to find different types of animals such as birds , rabbits and deer .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When they saw the animal , they could see that it was suffering , so they decided to free the deer .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Afterwards , the animal was better and it walked away slowly .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The question is : whether it is possible to be famous without journalists ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S That is why they are often able to sell information about their private life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S How about those who do not want to be popular because of scandals ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And when finally paparazzi notice that there is nothing interesting in their life , they just leave them alone .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Great food is probably one of the most valuable pleasures of life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Last Friday I visited a brand new Mexican restaurant in Lisbon called " Las Ficheras " .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I got curious about this place and decided to go later .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They served us " nachos " with tomato sauce for free while we were choosing the main dishes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S After choosing , a bottle of fresh water was served , again , for free .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We chose " tacos " of meat with guacamole sauce and it was absolutely delicious .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And also , where are you now ? ? :)
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As you know , Malta was a big punch right in the stomach , which for sure I did n't need ! :( .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The course and the organization left much to be desired ; and as if that were n't enough , my scholarship ( funny enough not the ones of the ( only ! ) TWO other participants ) , was not sufficient to cover all the costs ! :/
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Anyway , CS and magic saved me right at the last second ( the last night ) , and I left Malta with a smile and a warmed up heart .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And for that I want to THANK YOU once again .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He decided to finish the second half without my help , so that was a bit disappointing , both for the feeling of not meeting his expectations * and for the ( I 'm guessing , as I do n't know anything as yet :/ ) less money earned that it will mean .

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These problems just announced recently will be issues to talk about at the UN summit in Paris in three weeks .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Then , world leaders will be negotiating about cutting the increased carbon emissions coupled with the El Niño climate phenomenon .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Furthermore , climate scientist Ed Hawkins expects a continuation of global warming , clarifying this statement with the example of Central England , which has warmed 20% more than the global average .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The problem lies in the outdated framework in which the IWC operates .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Fifteen whaling nations formed the IWC after whale populations collapsed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The organisation was initially set up to conserve whales only to the extent that they could continue to be used by humans .

S The importance of World Heritage properties transcends national boundaries .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To be included on the World Heritage List , properties must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one of ten selection criteria .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The site is the property of the country on whose territory it is located , but it is considered in the interest of the international community to protect the site for future generations .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Its protection and preservation becomes a concern of the international World Heritage community as a whole .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Cricket is a team sport which teaches us team work , collaboration and strict discipline .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He has broken almost every record in cricket history .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It has nice articles , reviews and statistics on many players and games .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I ca n't stop thinking about it , because I realized that I had never stopped to think about my life in such a deep way .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S By the way , do you know what a Bucket List is ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is a list of things that you want to do before you die .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is very strange that another person became curious about a very profound part of me that I have never thought of .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Well , next November I will travel to Europe , the only certain thing on my Bucket List that I know .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Peoples lives will change in the future , and I bet it 's not for the better .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Unlike popular understandings of History ( and even presumably scientific ones , I must say ) , History is not an unstoppable march towards " progress " , whatever that word means .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Those later period Romans were n't even able to make the high quality cement that their ancestors were able to make and have technical mastery over just a few centuries earlier .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And who can safely say that three centuries from now humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and take for granted ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But I do n't think , unless there 's another World War , people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .

S Hi Sam ,
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It has been a long time since we were in touch and now I am very pleased that we are on holiday and we can plan something together .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S My family and I are going to spend some days at the same place we went to last year , at the Sunshine Holiday Camp .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Do you remember it ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I 've already mentioned to you how much fun I had there and why it was great !

S Could you ask your parents ' permission ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Simonetta
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The doorbell rang unexpectedly . I had fallen asleep on the couch watching TV .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I got up and I made my way to the front door .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Outside stood the most extraordinary - looking man : he looked like a Spanish elephant hunter .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I was taken aback , so I called my mother , who was asleep with her boyfriends .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S She came down , but she did not scream .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Instead she started crying .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I did not know that he was still alive .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Mother had always told me he had died in the war .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I think she did this for my own good .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I was very bemused by the situation and did n't know if I liked him or not .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In my dreams I had seen him as an intellectual but now he was in my sitting room and he looked like an elephant or something exotic .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was very odd to see him in my home .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Now we all live together .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Although the first days were difficult , now we all get on well .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is great to be a whole family again .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The Grand Place is the central square of Brussels .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is surrounded by several old buildings such as the city hall and the buildings of the corporations of the Middle Ages .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These were groups of people doing the same work , such as carpenters .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Sometimes , they became very rich .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Each building is decorated with the blazon of the corporation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Their architecture is unique and beautiful .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The square is covered with pavement and is a pedestrianized area .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Every year , when Christmas comes , there is an amazing show with music and lights on the façades of the buildings while a huge fir tree is placed in the centre of the square .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Wawel Royal Castle is one of the highest ranked monuments in the history and culture of Poland and Europe , so during the stay in Poland it is necessary to visit it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I recommend visiting Wawel Royal Castle because of its beauty and uniqueness .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I have been learning English as a second language since I was ten years old , which means a very long time ago .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S So I grew up thinking I could speak and write quite good English .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I decided to enrol for a creative writing course in order to practise my writing skills .

S Adolescence .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Everything is unknown , but we try to pretend that we know a lot of things .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Another thing about the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fact that they confuse our minds .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The worst part is that they get angry with us !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It 's a kind of love that struggles ; it makes butterflies fly in our stomach , it makes us dive into a sort of imaginary tale .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Dear group leader ,
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I really hope that you have a nice welcome and , please , feel at home .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the east of Mallorca you will find a small and beautiful village called Artà .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Nowadays , you can still see some fishermen fishing on the seashore .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Here your adventure starts .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This zone is part of a protected area , a natural park .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S As Machado said " se hace camino al andar " .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It means that the most important is the way , the journey .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the way to Ca los cans , you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There are a lot of trees called " tamarells " , native trees of the coast of Mallorca .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Finally , you will get to Ca los Cans .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is a special beach with stones instead of sand and surrounded by trees instead of hotels .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There you can practise different sports .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is a perfect place to go diving because you can see different fishes , sea urchins and seaweed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The function of the Talaiots is not clear yet .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Maybe it was a defensive tower or an important building for high - class people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The sunset in that place is ideal and romantic ( especially if you are with your partner ) and you will see how the sun goes behind the mountain range of Tramuntana .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S From that seashore you can see all the Alcúdia bay , part of the mountain range of Tramuntana and the cape of Formentor .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Ca los Cans is a mixture of sea , nature and culture .

S Introduction .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The aim of this report is to outline the best and the worst qualities of your centre after one year running .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This report analyses the two main facilities : the gym and the swimming pool .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The gym .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The machines are fantastic and the staff is very helpful with every customer .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , the gym is too small .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The swimming pool .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is ideal for people who do not compete because of its length , about 20 metres .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Furthermore , it is not too deep , so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , the changing rooms are too far from this facility , so it is easy to catch a cold when someone goes from one place to another .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Conclusions .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The facilities are quite modern and the staff are excellent but the gym could be bigger .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The Future of Public Transport
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A car allows us to move faster and not to depend on others .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In my opinion , it is not true .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , there will always be people who will not be able to afford to buy a car .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Secondly , cars can also turn into public transport .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Anyone can use the nearest car he or she sees .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is also true for older people , who lose the ability to drive as they age .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The chart above gives some information about the average monthly salaries of nurses and doctors in four different countries .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S According to the chart , the two countries with the lowest salaries are Country A and Country B.
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These ones are called " source countries " , which means that they provide a supply of health care workers to other countries .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Otherwise , the countries with the highest saliaries are country C and country D. Differently from the first two countries , these ones are called " destination countries " because the health care service is provided by foreign and qualified workers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In Country D , the salaries of doctors are about three times higher than those of nurses .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S More deaths would occur through boxing if it were banned .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Boxers chose to box , just as racing drivers drive .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In many of the minority works of modern literature , there can be some emphasis on rebellion against oppressive forces .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Although such a show of strength by these works ' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contribution to the otherwise insightful thought of the author , it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Rather , this ever - changing and ever - challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggle and a work inherently distinct from any other .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding force between all cultures , for Celie , too , resists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple , and the murderous loves in Jazz reflect Tita and Pedro 's destructive passion in Like Water for Chocolate .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Rebellion and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S How does Voltaire tackle the question of philosophical optimism in ' Candide ' ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Voltaire sets out in Candide to criticise this philosophy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The whole book is a criticism of l'optimisme .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On arrival they see starvation and death .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Candide is obviously horrified , especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Candide , although remaining true to the ideals of optimism , always appears to be sceptical of it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world , South America , and has to leave his darling Cunégonde with the Commissioner of the province .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant flow of disasters .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Candide 's life , in the book , appears to show this .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This illustrates emphatically the folly of l'optimisme .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It would be tempting to think of the various European Communities as an embryonic United States of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of European Unity .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When the original 13 American states resolved to form what is now the United States of America , they were intent on forming a political as well as economic entity .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A balance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self - government as possible while ensuring that , for example in military matters , the central government spoke for all .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is true that today one still hears the old dispute over state sovereignty and attempts to return some power to the individual states , but no - one would challenge the fact that , on matters external to the United States , the government in Washington represents the sole policy - making body .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Membership almost certainly involves some loss of national sovereignty , but the United Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westminster Parliament , something which no state in the United States could lawfully do .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Its ability to make and break any law - made by it or Europe - means that it retains full sovereignty .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The fact that Parliament does not bind itself or can not be bound by any political body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it and Parliament consented .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Naturally , the problems of a single Europe would run as deeply as the benefits that we would presumably ultimately receive .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Britain has been eager to maintain a secure balance of power on the continent , but throughout history , she has been more concerned with her oversees empires than with anywhere else .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We have established a system of law which dates back many centuries , and which is widely known and respected .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S With the creation of a single Europe , new law will have to be accepted throughout the continent , and it will cause both confusion and conflict .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Of course , the same points will apply to the monetary system in Europe .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Will there just be one system ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The country typically is against major change and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it was to be altered .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It can be said that if a single Europe was created , problems may arise over its fundamental political concepts .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Of course Britain would lose her sovereignty , as would the other nations of the union .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It has been suggested that the Single Union could be based on a basic federal structure , whereby local autonomy could be saved , but the union as a whole could work together in a democratic manner .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To a certain extent , even if sovereignty was lost , some national personality would be preserved .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There will always be aspects of one society that the others will never accept .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Europe as a whole faces the same problems , and therefore , if a single Europe was created , uniting Britain , the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If the Federalists achieved their aims in a European unity , they would do their best to achieve democracy and promote it nationally , so that individuality is preserved , and that all of their positive features will be known .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The problem facing the British , really results from their isolated past .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Whether this would happen awaits to be seen , and would depend completely on the terms of the union , and the negotiations and feelings of the general public and the politicians leading the countries .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S With 1992 now only a year away , the question of what a Single Europe will mean for Britain becomes increasingly relevant .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I firmly believe that the advent of 1992 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This loss need not however be negative .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Such sacrifices will involve certain aspects of our sovereignty .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I can see a future for some form of European rapid reaction force .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The North Sea will increasingly come to represent a mere puddle as people move between countries .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I feel it is important for Britain to join fully with its European partners to adapt to these changes in demography .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Possible problems should be studied and solved if possible before they happen .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In the area of the single currency , again I feel this is inevitable .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Britain must not concern itself with loss of sovereignty but gain of the European equivalent .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When the treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 , the foundation was laid for a new " continent " - a united Europe .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It was said that Europe would not be created quickly , but over several years .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The former Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher was not been to lead Britain into a United Europe because she felt it would lead to a loss of our sovereignty .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There is no doubt an integrated market would have multiple benefits for the countries involved .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Businesses and other trading organizations are preparing themselves for 1992 , and the single market .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There will be business booms and free competition with the removal of protective practices , along with greater freedom to travel .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Many Britons would consider Europe has affected Britain too much already , with decimalization , the new Euro - passports and now the pound sterling being tied to the ECU .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They may feel Britain is being pulled into Europe .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This may make Britons resentful of Europe and tired of " 1992 and all that " .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A single market requires one central institution to co - ordinate all movements of goods and policies .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Many people would not .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Will the day come when the pound sterling is taken over by the ECU ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Europe may argue that the benefits from a single integrated market would far outweigh any national drawbacks .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They must look into the future and consider possible effects .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Will Britain be drawn into Europe against its will ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Perhaps as more of Britain becomes " Eurofied " , Britons will wake up and see their sovereignty is being taken away .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Britain has never geographically been a part of Europe .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We are in the EEC and we should be able to benefit from free trade .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We have been an island for too long - being independent and able to stand alone .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We have a sound democratic process , which many people would not want to give this up .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There has been such a lot of talk about a Single Europe in recent years that it is hard to believe that it will be upon us very soon .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , a positive approach .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Looking at things from an economic perspective , this is not a problem .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The benefits in terms of cost - cutting owing to doing things once , instead of twelve times , will be enormous .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firms , because of being able to pool their resources , will be able to devote more time to research and development , and thus products will improve .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Europe will therefore be a nation to be reckoned with as regards competition .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S To look at things on a more individual level , every member of the new Single Europe 's standard of living should increase .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A greater potential of ideas from a greater number of experts will , in theory , result in more knowledgeable and better - informed individuals .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If this is so , they should also work better .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Ideally then , there should be more equality , less crime , greater productivity and greater economic growth .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the other hand , will this Single Europe mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It must be remembered that not only does Britain have a small population compared to the majority of the other member states , but it is an island - which none of the others are .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Why should this matter ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Well , Britain has quite a history and therefore a fair number of traditions .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is possible that it could become engulfed in the new Single Europe and lose its identity .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Britons ( especially those from older generations ) may then feel " lost " and that they do not really " belong " any more .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The new Single Europe may be too new and unknown for them to make their allegiance to it .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Then there is the question as to whether all this idealism really will work .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Will there be greater prosperity , better - informed , happier citizens , or will this never come off because of politicians being unable to agree on policies ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Has it then not got quite a lot at stake , its character at least , in integrating itself into this Single Europe ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S No one would dispute that this is a difficult question .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The fact remains however that next year ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a Single Europe .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This , as everyone is well aware , is not going to be achieved with ease , but the more tolerant every member state is of each other , the more successful the Single Europe will be .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Then we will all be able to look at the future in a more positive way .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The European Community is a unique grouping of twelve sovereign European Member States who are committed to the development of closer economic and political co - operation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The community has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In particular , the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers ; movement not only of goods but of services , capital and people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Let us look at the founding of the European Community , before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in more detail .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War , but only after Europe had again been devastated by war was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re - ordering of Europe .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This fresh start came about because of three main factors .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community , in 1958 .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty - three .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S One of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powers , which it can use to adopt acts , having the force of national law .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called " integration " .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S All of the member states agree in principle to the idea of a single market by 1992 , however each wish their own interests to be safeguarded .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is to say that none want to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many want unanimous voting , not majority voting .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If a feeling of European unity develops and can be sustained , the threat will subside as a feeling of identity takes over .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We all feel that we have a divine right to be on the road .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Why ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The whole system has now formed a spiraling circle of road use .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Despite being enjoyable to watch , boxing is very dangerous .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Last year , the fight between Chris Eubank and Micheal Watson led to calls for boxing to be banned when Micheal Watson slipped into a coma and was in a critical condition for some months .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Many youths in low income areas see boxing as ' a way out ' , a chance to make it to the top and earn a lot of money on the way .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There are , however , people who regard boxing as barbaric , brutal and primitive .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These people argue that there is no need for boxing and that it only promotes violence .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S During the fight , yes , of course it is violent , but this is controlled violence and fighters have a mutual respect for each other .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S All precautions are taken to ensure a safe fight .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Ambulances are also kept on stand by at big events .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Because there are so many budding young boxers , to ban boxing would be insane , since it would almost certainly go underground .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Taking this into account and considering that boxing is about hurting the opponent , it can be said that boxing is a relatively safe sport .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Which is good news for the majority of the British public .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There is always much speculation over the dangers of such a brutal sport as boxing .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is emphasised and exaggerated when a competitor in the sport tragically dies .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Let us consider how a professional boxer would feel .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S He is clearly aware of the dangers and brutalism of the sport , which is possibly why he enjoys it so much .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I have yet to hear any boxer regret his choice of career .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This member of the public does not want the sport to be banned either .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These individuals and others learning about the tragic incident in the media protest against the sport .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There were 2 main objections raised against the introduction of the national lottery .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The second and main objection came from charities who predicted that charitable donations would go down with the introduction of the lottery , as people would be less likely to give money to charity , instead buying a lottery ticket , with the excuse that some of the money spent buying the ticket would go to charity .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There was also some controversy over the awarding of the lottery organisation franchise , which eventually went to Camelot , which was not seen as the strongest contender for the bid : other companies or consortiums promised to give more money to charity with lower running costs .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Richard Bronson promised to give all of his profits to charity , but was rejected .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When it promised to give 45 pence in every pound to charitable causes , it neglected to promise that most or all of this money would go to charity .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There has also been some controversy over the allocation of money .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Now the lottery is in place , it would be very difficult to remove it from society .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The computer has been one of the most influential inventions of all time .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Computers now dominate the majority of government business , science and communication , as well as many other areas of human life .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In many ways , it has taken the place of the human brain in performing calculations and thought processes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This , unfortunately , means that the genius scientist is being replaced by the powerful computer and its operator , who needs only to know which buttons to press .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This may seem an extreme view , as there is still much in the world of maths and science which a computer can not calculate , but this may not be the case centuries into the future .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Computers have been used as a means of keeping records , they have all but superseded handwritten text , ( in a few decades people may well be faced with a computer screen and keyboard in their General Studies exam ) , they are used to transfer money across the globe , even to create artwork and to entertain .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Computer generated pictures , including ' fractal ' pictures , drawn from equations , seem to be more popular than hand printed images from an artist 's imagination , and computer games seem to provide more entertainment than any game or activity that takes place in the real , physical world .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Virtual reality allows people to have ' 3-D ' entertainment created for them by a computer .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Whether or not the computer is taking over from the human brain , it has certainly made the human body all but redundant .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S People , businesses or corporations can be contacted at any point around the globe by fax machines , e - mail and the internet , and some people prefer these forms of communication to actually meeting face to face .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Money can be transferred instantly without even needing to move the actual money - the physical coinage does n't matter , it is the computer records that state how much each bank has ownership of .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Human beings often act without logic or reason , and only other human beings can cope and deal with that .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They cried , they cheered .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Their faces expressed joy , triumph , pride and perplexity .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Within a few weeks , the excitement had died down and people had turned their attention to more recent news .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But for me , this had been the start .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , they will have at least seen the " other side " .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The development and implementation of technology has affected societies in every corner of the world .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I do not speak of a certain object in particular , but of technology as a whole .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Science and technology have allowed me to travel to this part of the world , they have provided a living for my family , they have cured my grandmother of cancer , and they provide horizons of hope and knowledge in the fields of medicine , science , engineering , and even the less overt corners of our lives .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S People say that technological development has made our world much smaller ,
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S and I would concur that a great majority of Americans live in their own personal closets .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In schools , Geography classes rarely , if ever , exist .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Before I came to Spain , a group of children asked me if Spain was in Michigan .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Explaining that Spain was located across the ocean did not seem to improve their understanding of the layout of our world .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Our awareness of other people , other cultures , and other languages is very low on the priority list of our educators .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Mine is not the only experience like this .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In many shops , the cashiers appear to be dumbfounded by the simplest of sums without the aid of their tills .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In many areas , the skill of human judgement has been replaced by faster , more accurate , computers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Many people have had their job positions taken over by computers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Filing cabinets are becoming a thing of the past with computer databases .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But even such menial tasks as filing are good for us .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They encourage organisational skills and tidiness .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S When people talk about artificial intelligence ( AI ) , you hear many funny tales from people who are convinced that the computers are coming alive and will eventually rule us .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S These are just the rantings of people who have nothing to do with computers and who do not realise that behind every computer is a programmer .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Even ' artificial intelligence ' needs to be programmed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Human brains still work out how to build the computers , how to program them and , more importantly , how to control them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Reflexes are improved ( and this has been scientifically proven ) by playing computer games , the very same things that parents say turn their children into ' zombies ' .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S We can expand our imagination and convert our ideas into computer simulated models , enabling us to design buildings and road networks .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The computer revolution has not made our brains redundant , it has opened up areas of them we never knew existed !
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is now the age of the computer .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Almost everyone owns a computer or has access to one .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They are able to generate amazingly accurate graphical representations and perform extremely difficult mathematical equations in just seconds .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Computers have become a huge part of our lives in both the areas of work and education .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But are they such a good thing ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The computer could do the same thing .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This could be argued to be educational .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They should be out enjoying themselves and gaining experiences for themselves instead of reading about them on a flat screen .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It is said that you can meet people through computers and have ' relationships ' .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I find this preposterous and people are losing the ability to communicate and form relationships .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This could lead to high unemployment .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Those people who work with computers for long periods of time every day face problems .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S I agree that computers are helpful but people should not live through their computers and be so reliant on them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S They should read books and live more in order to regain their lost imagination and sense of adventure .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There are many beneficial aspects of genetic manipulation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There can be no doubt that genetic manipulation and genetic engineering have had highly beneficial effects on many areas of society .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , many people dislike or are prejudiced against , genetic manipulation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This has been very good to feed popular culture ( the film ' Jurassic Park ' being an obvious reference point ) .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Anything in life can be misused .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Everything in life , if misused , can have harmful effects and genetic engineering and genetic manipulation are no exception .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The other fundamental flaw is assuming that individual scientists have responsibility , Science is a process of discovery rather than creation , ie .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S no - one created genetic manipulation , the power of it was there to be discovered .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The only argument for making scientists responsible for their work , is that quite often , and particularly in the case of genetic manipulation , it would need a scientist to misuse knowledge , and therefore they should be responsible .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S While genetic manipulation is relatively new , it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefore an individual scientist could be held responsible .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Some of them are listed below :
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The other problem is that people say ( or think ) that they do not do anything but they are rich and also they do not pay any taxes .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The egg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimise the chances of fertilisation by the sperm from the father .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This usually leads to multiple births ie .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S twins , triplets etc .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The people who are for this can argue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S 1 . Fertility treatment should not be given to post - menopausal women .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S 2 .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Eggs should not be taken from aborted foetuses .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The foetuses will have been aborted for a reason for example : if it was the result of a rape or if it had congenital deformities .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Science has moved on dramatically since the C19th .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Many new things have been invented and many things medically have changed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S All the above are carried out on living people , but nowadays biological operations can be carried out on humans which are not even born .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is called ' in vitro fertilisation ' .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S What I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is post - menopausal decides she wants a baby .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The child may also have to look after the mother in her old age .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The way the sex can be chosen is by using genetics .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This may lead to an increase in one sex , and a decline in the other .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Science is progressing all the time , but is it for the best ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The so - called ' mad cow disease ' seemed to make the cows lose all sense of balance and direction , stumbling around drunkenly .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Herds where this disease was found were put down before the symptoms progressed further .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Those cows which had been put down were not used for food .

S People normally associated with politics , religion , or art are quickly lumped into categories regardless of individual differences .

S This tragedy is worsened by the tendency of those outside the movement to remember the radical and ignore the common or ordinary .

S Television has the power to bring war into the home as well as artistic expressions of those involved in the program production , giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture more fully .

S However , this is not the way in which television has influenced society .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S On the contrary , television has become the escape route of the masses , a way for people to flee from the conflicts they experience in their culture , rather than confront them and try to understand them .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In the minds of most Americans , television is regarded as a diversion rather than an educational tool , as free entertainment instead of easily accessible knowledge .

S Television , therefore , has changed society in ways that could hardly have been dreamed of 00 years ago .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It has given society another creative vein , a look at worlds which could be seen in no other way , and an opportunity to better educate itself .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S It has caused a lot of prejudice and paranoia among people which has torn them apart .

S In the second of the world wars , the race was on to create the most devastating , most powerful , and most frightening weapon our people had ever known .

S As missile technology and nuclear fusion capacities increased and improved , fear began to replace nationalism , and our small world erected barriers between its members .

S As discoveries of new antibiotics decreased , chemists began to wonder if certain variations of these drugs could be synthesized and also used as medicine .

S The mental effect of computers is two - fold .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , computers have made mathematical computations so easy to do , many people do not fully understand how or why their computer works .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This has created a surplus of " needless " computations , figures , etc .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Mathematical models , theories , etc .

S A computer 's circuits do n't get tired and , if programmed 100% correctly ( another perhaps impossible computation ) , never make errors .

S The first significant equal rights movement in the U.S. was in the 70s with the Equal Rights Amendment , which failed .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Feminism does not only have to do with work and money , but also with the image of women .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S A recognition of such influences on the image of women is the first step in breaking it down , so that women are seen for who they truly are .

S Feminism is better described as a " discovery in progress " ; it 's a movement , an attitude that has not yet become mainstream .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0
